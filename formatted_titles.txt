    "formatted_review_text": "<p>The premise has a beautiful simplicity to it. Safety-deposit vaults in Hamburg are being used by an assortment of white-collar crooks to hold money they legally shouldn't possess. There is a supply sergeant who is ripping off the U.S. Army, a shady character from Los Vegas, a guy who deals in drugs, and so on. The thing they have in common is that they can't squawk if they find their lock-boxes empty. They weren't supposed to be full to begin with. </p>\r<p>This situation gradually emerges during the first 15 minutes of Richard Brooks' \"$\", a slick and breakneck caper movie that runs like a well-oiled thrill. <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/warren-beatty\">Warren Beatty</a> plays a smooth-talking American expert in anti-burglary devices, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/goldie-hawn\">Goldie Hawn</a> gets a job in the bank and they devise an exquisitely complicated plan that gets Beatty into the bank vault but out of view while the entire bank staff applauds what they think is, a demonstration of the latest Yankee Security devices.</p><p>The story is of course much more complicated than that, but twists, turns and double-reverse whammies are the very soul of the caper movie. Brooks, a craftsman writer-director whose recent credits includes \"The Professionals\" and \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-in-cold-blood-1967\">In Cold Blood</a>,\" has fun with the structure of his movie. It works something like recent <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/robert-altman\">Robert Altman</a> films; Brooks never stops to explain anything, never lingers over a plot, never bores us with lectures and explanations. Instead, all hischaracters plunge ahead, obsessed with greed.</p>\r<p>Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn are weirdly interesting together. Their acting styles lie at right angles, so you get two textures in the same scene. Since the visual style of the movie keeps whamming textures against each other, this contrast in the acting really works.</p>\r<p>Beatty is the best con man in movies, certainly since <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/clark-gable\">Clark Gable</a> died. He is filled with deals, angles, things he has to pull you over in a corner to whisper. He can make you rich tomorrow, and himself, too, one of these days. And he has an unusual kind narcissism -- unusual for an actor. He isn't narcissistic about himself, but about his style; he's in love with conning people. </p>\r<p>Up against Beatty's con, Goldie Hawn is pure gullibility. Her eyes\rare big enough to make a Keane painting look representational, and\rwhen she walks, it's as if she were finally getting the knack. How\rthese two people got together is never made much of in \"$.\" They're\rtoo absorbed in getting all those dollars, those marks and liras and\rfrancs, out of that vault and into their arms. It is good to see people who enjoy working together. Brooks is good at showing it too; we got a sense of camaraderie in a shared goal in \"The Professionals\"\rand \"In Cold Blood,\" and now in \"$.\" All of the goals are illegal, of\rcourse, but that's the frosting.</p>\r<p>One of the curious people who turns up in \"$\" is <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/scott-brady\">Scott Brady</a>, the wide gauge second lead in lots of 1950 movies. He always looked as if he knew how to dance and which fork to use, but could also help you out if you had a dry cleaner that needed to be fire-bombed. Late Show fans will recall \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/johnny-guitar-1954\">Johnny Guitar</a>\" and \"Gentlemen Marry Brunettes.\" Brooks cast him as the supply sergeant, and the casting gives the whole movie a nice gritty feeling of avarice. In the chase scene at the end, he pursues Beatty with a single-minded fanaticism that is truly remarkable.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>Walt Disney's \"$1,000,000 Duck\" is one of the most profoundly stupid movies I've ever seen. It is a movie about a duck that gets an overdose of radiation and starts laying golden eggs. It is also about the people who won the duck, and about how greed and avarice appear in their lives, and about the lesson in love and understanding that the father gets when his son runs away with the duck and becomes trapped on a ladder between the ledges of two tall buildings, and about how the father gets a fair trial from the American judiciary system.</p>\r<p>The people in this movie inhabit a universe of clean little 1940s bungalows with rose trellises, and there's a mean neighbor next door and some teenagers down the street who are always souping up their hot rod. This universe looks vaguely familiar, and you wonder where you've seen it before. It certainly doesn't exist in the current American space-time continuum, but maybe...</p>\r<p>And then you recognize the universe. The reason you had trouble before was that you'd never seen the WHOLE universe before, but only its laundry room. This is the universe of those sweet, simple folks who live in TV soap ads. They mean well, poor souls, and they dress neatly and keep a cheery smile, but they must have been shortchanged in the smarts department because all they care about in this life is how white their whites get. At night they have surrealistic dreams in which their towels come out whiter and whiter and whiter until the whole laundry room is filled with dazzling metaphysical sunlight, and (at last!) their towels are clean and their sins forgiven.</p>\r<p>The woman in the family in the movie has apparently survived nine years of marriage since she has an 8-year-old son, but her survival must have been a matter of blind luck. She makes applesauce with garlic in it because she doesn't know any better, and she takes a golden egg down to the bank when her checking account gets overdrawn. Being married to such a mentality would be wearying to her husband, you imagine; he is a young scientist engaged in teaching rabbits and ducks to walk down the ramp and through the maze and push the right button and be rewarded with rabbit food or duck food.</p>\r<p>There was a Stan Freberg record once about a rat that was put through this ordeal. Over drawbridges. Up ramps. Through doors. Past dead-ends. Across the moat. Up the ladder. And finally, finally...when the exhausted rodent reached his objective and punched the right button, do you know what came out of the little door for him to eat? One single chlorophyll gumball.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>The 'Burbs tries to position itself somewhere between <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/beetlejuice-1988\">Beetlejuice</a> and The Twilight Zone, but it lacks the dementia of the first and the wicked intelligence of the second and turns instead into a long shaggy dog story. It's about a group of nosy neighbors who grow concerned when a strange new family moves into their neighborhood and settles into a crumbling Gothic house that seems as out of place in the split-level suburbs as a tarantula on an angel food cake.</p>\r<p>Who are these people? They're never seen in the daylight, but at night their basement windows flash and crackle with giant discharges of electricity, and sometimes they can be seen out in their backyard, digging holes. For what? Corpses? Loot? They're like the Addams Family, ghoulish and aloof. They look like they were born under rocks and have never seen the light of day.</p>\r<p>It would be wrong to say the neighbors are annoyed. Actually, they seem cheered by this sinister visitation in their midst: It gives them something to think about other than mowing the lawn or walking the dog. The hero of the film, Ray Peterson (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/tom-hanks\">Tom Hanks</a>), has started his vacation just as the story begins, and instead of going fishing he elects to stay home and spy on the neighbors. His wife (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/carrie-fisher\">Carrie Fisher</a>) thinks this is childish behavior, but his neighbors (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/bruce-dern\">Bruce Dern</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/rick-ducommun\">Rick Ducommun</a>) are overgrown boys who enter enthusiastically into the enterprise.</p>\r<p>Meanwhile, the film provides lots of little vignettes of suburban life, involving such staples as the neighbor who allows his dog to poop on other people's lawns and the housewife who likes to do her yard work in the briefest of halter tops. None of this material is as funny as it might have been, partly because it seems recycled out of fairly ancient ideas of what the suburbs are really like (I kept expecting to see Dennis the Menace or Mr. Wilson wandering down the street).</p>\r<p>The movie was directed by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/joe-dante\">Joe Dante</a>, who contributed that eerie segment to The Twilight Zone movie in which the people in an isolated farmhouse all seemed to coexist in a comic-book dimension (they were the original Toons). This time, with a related idea at feature length, he seems to have run out of inspiration. One of the things he could have exploited was the very falseness of the suburban sets he uses. The street he shoots on may, for all I know, actually exist somewhere, but it looks for all the world like that permanent small-town set they drive you through on the Universal Tour.</p>\r<p>It's hard to put your finger on exactly what's missing from the movie. The actors do what they can with the material and the special effects are ambitious, but somehow the film fails to rouse itself into any real conviction. It's cut and dried; we anticipate the major events in the story and we're right. And when the explanation for the strange family's behavior finally arrives, it's not much of a surprise.</p>\r<p>That family is led, by the way, by a small, pale, fish-faced doctor played by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/henry-gibson\">Henry Gibson</a> (the Oscar nominee from <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-nashville-1975\">Nashville</a>).</p>\r<p>Watching him in the final scenes of the movie, I realized his character was more interesting than the suburbanites we'd been following all along. Maybe that's what the movie was missing: a comic inversion to undermine all of our expectations. What if the typical suburbanites had all been undernourished geeks and the sinister new family had moved in looking all-American? Only asking.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>In Dexter Gordon's voice in \"Round Midnight,\" there is a quality that at first sounds like a great weariness. As I listened more carefully, however, I realized that there were other notes present.</p><p>Here is a man (I speak of the character, not the actor) who has gone too far and seen too much, and who knows that in one way or another his death is near. Yet he is not impatient with those who still have long to live; he takes what remains of his precious time to speak carefully with them. And when he speaks of the world around him, it is with a quiet amazement that he is still there to see it.</p><p>I mention Gordon's voice because it plays the same notes as the music in this film. As with all great musicians, the notes that come from within are the same as the feelings from within. Musicians who use breath to play their instruments - those who play the various horns - arrive sooner or later at a point where they play and speak in the same voice. Gordon makes it easy to hear that; the music that comes from his saxophone is sad and tender, and so are his words.</p><p>In \"Round Midnight,\" he plays Dale Turner, an American jazzman who goes to Paris in 1959 to play at a club called the Blue Note. Turner is about 60, an alcoholic and drug user whose pattern has been to pull things together for a while and then let them slide. Each slide is closer to death.</p><p>He is on the wagon in Paris, watched over by a ferocious landlady and a vigilant club owner, who want him sober so he can get his job done. In the smoky little club every night, he plays the new music of Monk and Bird, the standards of Gershwin and Porter, and songs that come up spontaneously while they are being played.</p><p>Outside in the rain one night, a young Frenchman stands by a window, listening to the music, not caring if he gets wet. He believes Turner is the greatest sax player in the world, but he doesn't have enough money to go inside to hear him. One night he follows the old man out of the club and is able to see without much trouble that Turner needs help. So he offers it.</p><p>Turner is the most hopeless kind of alcoholic, the kind who tries to stay dry by depending on his own willpower and the enforcement of others. Sooner or later, his willpower will advise him to drink, and sooner or later the others will not be there, so sooner or later he will be drunk. The young Frenchman senses this, and also senses the overwhelming loneliness of Dale's life, and invites him home for food and talk.</p><p>That seemingly very slight gesture - a fan trying to help the man he admires - is the heart of \"Round Midnight.\" This is not a heavily plotted movie, one of those musical biographies weighted down with omens and light on music. It is about a few months in a man's life, and about his music. It has more jazz in it than any other fiction film ever made, and it is probably better jazz; it makes its best points with music, not words.</p><p>Gordon plays the central role with an eerie magnetism. He is a musician, not an actor, and yet no actor could have given this performance, with its dignity, wisdom and pain. He speaks slowly, carefully considering, really making his words mean something, so even commonplace sentences (\"Francois, this is a lovely town you have here\") are really meant. He calls everyone \"Lady\" in the movie, and doesn't explain it, and doesn't need to.</p><p>The music was recorded live. The director, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/bertrand-tavernier\">Bertrand Tavernier</a>, has said that in earlier jazz films, the audience could sense that the actors were not really playing; that you could see in their eyes that they were not listening to the other musicians onstage with them. In \"Round Midnight,\" the music happens as we hear it, played by Gordon, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/herbie-hancock\">Herbie Hancock</a> on piano and others such as Freddie Hubbard, Bobby Hutcherson, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/ron-carter\">Ron Carter</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/billy-higgins\">Billy Higgins</a>, with <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/lonette-mckee\">Lonette McKee</a> on vocals.</p><p>You do not need to know a lot about jazz to appreciate what is going on because, in a certain sense, this movie teaches you everything about jazz that you really need to know.</p><p>There are side stories: Dale's old loves, new possibilities, painful memories, battles with drink, and his suicidal decision to return to New York (where he is awaited by a slick agent and a patient, fatalistic heroin dealer). They all add up to the story of the end of a life. The story needs a song, and the movie has the song, \"Round Midnight.\"</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>Here is the most tiresome and affected movie in many a moon, a 114-minute demonstration of the Idiot Plot, in which everything could be solved with a few well-chosen words that are never spoken.</p><p>The underlying story is a simple one: A man and a woman who are obviously intended for each other are kept apart for an entire movie, only to meet at the end. We're supposed to be pleased when they get together, I guess, although the movie ends with such unseemly haste that we never get to experience them as a couple.</p><p>\"'Til There Was You,'' directed by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/scott-winant\">Scott Winant</a> with a screenplay by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/winnie-holzman\">Winnie Holzman</a>, plays like half-digested remnants of a dozen fictional meals. We have flashbacks to the love stories of parents, college love affairs, shocking revelations about sexuality and parentage, a maladjusted former sitcom star, an architect who is a \"perfectionist with low self-esteem,'' a ghost writer who falls in love with a colorful old apartment building, not one but two colorful old ladies who stick to their guns, a restaurant that's an architectural nightmare, zoning hearings, bad poetry, endlessly falling rose petals, chain-smoking, gays in the closet, traffic accidents--and at the end of it all, we have the frustration of knowing that 114 minutes of our lives have been wasted, never to be returned.</p><p>Oh, and we have disastrous casting decisions. I find it helpful, as a general rule, to be able to tell the characters in a movie apart. Several of the characters in this film (a gay college professor, an architect, and another guy) look so much alike I was forever getting them confused. They were all sort of would-be <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/pierce-brosnan\">Pierce Brosnan</a> clones. Since the plot depends on coincidental meetings (and close misses) involving people who should know one another but don't, and people who do know one another but shouldn't, the lookalikes grow even more confusing. The casting director no doubt thought that since several of the leads have appeared on TV sitcoms, the audience would recognize them and not be distracted by superficial physical similarities. Sorry.</p><p>The plot: A former sitcom star (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/sarah-jessica-parker\">Sarah Jessica Parker</a>) owns a wonderful old apartment complex that has been earmarked for replacement by a condominium building. She begins to date the architect (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/dylan-mcdermott\">Dylan McDermott</a>) who will design the condos. His hero is an old lady architect (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/nina-foch\">Nina Foch</a>) who is apparently the Frank Lloyd Wright of her generation. She designed the colorful old apartment complex, but he doesn't know that. (How likely is it that an architect would be unfamiliar with one of his famous mentor's key buildings in the city where he lives? Not very.) Meanwhile, a ghost writer (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jeanne-tripplehorn\">Jeanne Tripplehorn</a>) is hired by the sitcom star to write her autobiography. The ghost writer and the architect met when they were children at summer camp. They are destined to meet again, but keep missing each other by inches or minutes. Some of their near-misses take place in a restaurant the architect designed.</p><p>This restaurant, of frightening ugliness, seems designed to keep personal injury lawyers in work. When Tripplehorn enters it for the first time, she can't get the door open. Then it flies open and she staggers across the entire room and bangs into something. Later, she beans herself on a low-flying sculpture, trips over a waiter, catches her heel in the floor, falls over a chair, etc. Did she train for a \"Three Stooges'' movie? All of the movie's heartfelt scenes are tangential. They involve major characters talking to minor ones instead of to one another. There is the heartfelt talk between the architect and his mentor. And the heartfelt talk between the ghost writer and a dotty old lady (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/gwen-verdon\">Gwen Verdon</a>) who lives in the colorful old building (which the writer staggered into after a coincidental car crash). There is the heartfelt talk between the writer and her old father, who tells her the childhood legends the movie began with were all fiction. There is the heartfelt love scene between the writer and her college professor, who is later revealed to be gay, and then disappears from the movie just when we thought the story would be about him.</p><p>Many details are just plain wrong. Since the Tripplehorn character is a literature student, we expect her to be a fairly sophisticated writer. Yet when we hear one of her poems read (after it accidentally sticks to the bottom of an architectural model thrown out of a window--but never mind), it turns out to be written in rhyming couplets of the sort found beneath the needlework column in craft magazines. All of the characters smoke unpleasantly, and want to stop, and one of the movie's near-misses, where the would-be lovers almost meet, is at an \"N.A.'' meeting, which is described as \"Nicotine Anonymous.'' Warning: Before dropping \"N.A.'' into your conversation, be aware that most people think it means something else.</p><p>And what about those rose petals? Or lilac petals, or whatever they are? The courtyard of the colorful old building, we can clearly see, has no foliage above it. Yet petals drift down in endless profusion for days and weeks during every scene--so many, I sat through the end credits in the futile hope there would be mention of the Petal Dropper.</p><p>All comes together at the end. Landmarks are saved, hearts are mended, long-deferred love is realized, coincidences are explained, the past is healed, the future is assured, the movie is over. I liked the last part the best.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>\"(Untitled)\" picks a fight with its very title, which summarizes the f-you attitude of its hero, a composer of music that sounds like something you'd hear going on in the alley late at night. One of his compositions consists of a chain dropped into a can, a pennywhistle, loudly ripping paper, a bucket being kicked, the screams of a vocalist and squawks on a clarinet. He plays the piano with his elbows. Under the circumstances, it seems ungracious for him to complain about an audience member's cell phone.</p><p>This musician is named Adrian Jacobs (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/adam-goldberg\">Adam Goldberg</a>), a bearded thirtysomething who seems to have chugged a pint of bile. A good audience for him might consist of two dozen people; some walk out and the rest stare incredulously at the stage. One day his brother Josh (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/eion-bailey\">Eion Bailey</a>) brings a date to his concert. This is Madeleine Gray (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/marley-shelton\">Marley Shelton</a>), who runs a very, very avant-garde art gallery in Soho. Adrian asks he if can borrow her dress. It's made of shiny black plastic, it squeaks when she walks, and he thinks he can use the sound in his music.</p><p>\"(Untitled)\" is a comedy worthy of the best <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/woody-allen\">Woody Allen</a>, and Adrian is not unlike Woody's persona: a sincere, intense, insecure nebbish, hopeless with women, aiming for greatness. He plays classical piano brilliantly, and with contempt. If his \"serious\" work appeals to very few people, that's too many for him. Josh, however, is raking in the dough with his canvases, which are snatched up in volume for the lobbies of hotels.</p><p>The movie plunges fearlessly but not brainlessly into the world of art so cutting edge it has run out of edges. Remember Damien Hirst, the British artist who inspired a firestorm when he won the Turner Prize for such works as a shark preserved in formaldehyde? One of Madeleine's clients is Ray Barko (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/vinnie-jones\">Vinnie Jones</a>), whose art consists of a dead cat splayed on a wall, a goose apparently buried in a wall up to its wings, and a montage for a monkey and vacuum cleaner. A rich client (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/zak-orth\">Zak Orth</a>) eats up this stuff. Lots of people do. I don't know if they enjoy it as much as I love my Edward Lear watercolors. Maybe they love it more. </p><p>Madeleine hires Adrian and his musicians to perform at her gallery, as \"conceptual art.\" Well, I once attended a poetry reading featuring a revolving fan. Madeleine goes nuts for Adrian, and he finds her hard to resist because everything she wears makes noise. She seems to conceal a sound-effects artist in her knickers. Adrian tunes in; the soundtrack subtly enhances what he hears. They grow chummy. He attends Madeleine's opening for an artist named Monroe, played by an actor named <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/ptolemy-slocum\">Ptolemy Slocum</a>, whose own name is a work of art. Meanwhile, Josh's insipid work (pastels of vague shapes adorned by small circles) supports the gallery, but Madeleine keeps them in the back room. He \"doesn't need\" a gallery opening, she explains. She hates them, is what it is.</p><p>It's easy to take cheap shots at conceptual art. \"(Untitled)\" doesn't do that. It takes expensive shots. Adrian's music has been created for the film by the respected composer David Lang, and Ray Barko's grotesque animals were created by Los Angeles artist Kyle Ng. The thing is, their deliberately (I think) absurd work resembles the real thing, when lesser movies would just ask the art department to drum up something. Barko's \"work,\" given the right setting, would sell. That gives the film plausibility.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jonathan-parker\">Jonathan Parker</a>, who directed and co-wrote with Catherine di Napoli (they collaborated on \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/bartleby-2002\">Bartleby</a>\"), also respects these artists -- in a sense. Adrian can manifestly play the piano in a traditional way, so his music is a choice, not a necessity. Ray Barko has so many problems that his art may be a valid expression of his misery. Doubt remains about Monroe (played by Ptolemy Slocum, you will recall), whose pieces include a label reading <i>Untitled White Wall</i>, which is displayed on a white wall. Not any old white wall, you understand. It has to be the <i>right</i> white wall. I wonder if he'd need to tear up part of your house for its proper installation.</p><p>This is a good film, a smart film. It knows a lot about art and wears its knowledge lightly, dealing with its subject in a way even a student at the Art Institute might not find condescending. As so often happens, casting decisions help enormously in its success. As Madeleine, Marley Shelton is like a lot of bright, formidable young women, ambitious, idealistic, bored by most of the men she meets. Vinnie Jones plays Barko as a reunion of pugnacious British eccentrics. Do not overlook the fetching <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/lucy-punch\">Lucy Punch</a>, as a member of Adrian's band known only as \"The Clarinet.\" Shelton has the confidence and presence of a born comedienne, and as for Adam Goldberg, he plays the role without shred of humor, which is exactly right. </p><p>Meanwhile, I have put out a Google alert to see if New York gossips identify the original(s) for the rich collector.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>Here's an angry comedy crossed with an expose and held together by one of those high-voltage <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/al-pacino\">Al Pacino</a> performances that's so sure of itself we hesitate to demur. Pacino plays an aggressive young Baltimore lawyer who has worked within the system for 12 years or so -- he's not a reformer fresh out of law school -- but who, during the course of this movie, is driven to advise the American system of jurisprudence to stick its head where the sun don't shine.</p><p>Pacino's immediate inspiration is a judge named Fleming (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/john-forsythe\">John Forsythe</a>) who rather unexpectedly becomes his client. Forsythe looks marvelously like a judge. He has the razor-cut grey hair and the tired, thoughtful eyes and the gentleman's vague sneer when addressing a lawyer in his courtroom.</p><p>We get the impression that he saved himself a lot of time, early in his time on the bench, by resolving never to allow considerations of simple humanity to interfere with his handling of a case.</p><p>That angers Pacino, because Pacino has a client who has been in jail for months because of Forsythe. The client, as it happens, is innocent. Everyone seems agreed on that point. But the client was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and was filed away in a cell during a hiccup in standard police procedure, and cannot get out again until Pacino and Forsythe can agree on several meaningless technicalities.</p><p>They cannot. Forsythe seems to take a quiet sadistic pleasure in frustrating Pacino while his client goes through a crack-up in jail. Meanwhile, Pacino's life is complicated on other fronts. It is, in fact, complicated on too many other fronts: \"...and Justice for All\" has so many characters doing so many things to, with and against Pacino that it's a triumph of film making when all the stories end in the same movie.</p><p>There is a girlfriend, and a neurotic law partner, and another nutty client, and a stark raving mad senior judge (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jack-warden\">Jack Warden</a>) who indulges his suicidal impulses by eating his lunch on a fifth-floor window ledge and seeing if his helicopter will fly without gasoline.</p><p>These subplots are all thrown into the story's way without much regard as to whether they're serious and subtle or broad and comic; the movie is a compromise involving various approaches to the material. But Pacino's performance forces a kind of logic on the events.</p><p>We somewhat suspiciously accept the movie's swings of tone because Pacino remains consistent, and because he seems to remember what the basic issues are even when the movie detours into irrelevant episodes like the helicopter flight.</p><p>Then things tighten up just in time: When the movie seems about to become a series of sketches, it turns out that Forsythe is a prime suspect in the brutal rape and beating of a young girl.</p><p>Is he innocent, as he claims? Guilty? He wants Pacino to handle his defense: Inevitably, it's going to look as if the fix is in unless the defense is conducted by a lawyer who's clearly on record as despising Forsythe.</p><p>But . . . what if Forsythe's guilty? What does Pacino do then? What he does is borrowed from \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-network-1976\">Network</a>\" and \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-one-flew-over-the-cuckoos-nest-1975\">One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest</a>\" and other recent celebrations of the manic rebel personality in confrontation with the immoral establishment. The closing courtroom scenes are constructed as a machine to make the audience cheer, and the machine works.</p><p>Whether it works a little cynically is left for the audience to decide: \"...and Justice for All\" has been so many things and struck so many tones by the ending that it's not a statement, it's an anthology. Maybe, when Pacino's courtroom scene gathers force, we just forget the farce and soap opera and romantic comedy that went before, and take the scene as self-contained.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"><a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/blake-edwards\">Blake Edwards</a>'s \"10\" is perhaps the first comedy about terminal yearning. Like all great comedies, it deals with emotions very close to our hearts: In this case, the unutterable poignance of a man's desire for a woman he cannot have. The woman, of course, must be unbelievably desirable (and the hero of \"10,\" on a scale of 1 to 10, gives this particular woman an 11). It helps, too, if the man is short, forty-two years old, and filled with inchoate longings.</span><br></p>\r<p>You remember inchoate longings. They used to stalk the pages of novels by Thomas Wolfe, back in the years before the Me Generation and the cult of instant gratification. There used to be a time, incredibly, when you couldn't have something just because you wanted it. \"10\" remembers that time. Its hero, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/dudley-moore\">Dudley Moore</a>, begins \"10\" as a man who seems to have more or less what any man could desire. He is a successful composer. His girlfriend is <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/julie-andrews\">Julie Andrews</a>. He has a great house up in the hills, he drives a Rolls-Royce, he has cable TV with remote tuning.</p>\r<p>But then one day, driving his Rolls down Santa Monica Boulevard, he is visited by a vision. She is a preternaturally beautiful young woman in the next car. She turns to regard him, and he is instantly, helplessly, in love. She turns away. She must be about her business. She is dressed in a bridal gown and is on her way to the church to be married.</p>\r<p>He follows her. He is stung by a bee in the church. He has six cavities painfully filled by her father, who is a dentist. Groggy from pain pills and brandy, he finds himself aboard an airplane flying to Mexico -- where, amazingly, he winds up at the same resort as his ideal woman (and, of course, her husband -- one of the vacuous beach-boy types with a smile fit for a Jockey T-shirts model).</p>\r<p>Blake Edwards's screenplay now plunges into some slightly more serious waters, where we will not follow. What we're struck with, in \"10,\" is the uncanny way its humor gets laughs by touching on emotions and yearnings that are very real for us. We identify with the characters in this movie: Their predicaments are funny, yes -- but then ours would be, too, if they weren't our own.</p>\r<p>The central treasure in the film is the performance by Dudley Moore. There must have been times when Moore wondered if he'd ever get the girl. In \"10,\" he does. He also brings his character such life and dimension that \"10\" is a lot more than a comedy: It's a study in the follies of human nature.</p>\r<p>The girl (the one who scores 11) is played by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/bo-derek\">Bo Derek</a>. She is so desirable, such a pure and cheerful embodiment of carnal perfection, that we're in there with Dudley Moore every step of the way, even when he's slogging it out to Ravel's interminable \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/bolero-1984\">Bolero</a>.\" </p>\r<p>Julie Andrews has a small but delightful role as the sensible mistress, and the movie also has warm performances by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/robert-webber\">Robert Webber</a>, as Moore's vulnerable gay friend, and by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/brian-dennehy\">Brian Dennehy</a>, as a particularly understanding bartender in Mexico.</p>\r<p>\"10\" is not only one of the best films Blake Edwards has ever made, but was something of a turning point in his career: The previous decade he had alternated between successful Pink Panther movies and non-Panther flops like \"The Tamarind Seed,\" \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-wild-rovers-1971\">The Wild Rovers</a>,\" and \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-carey-treatment-1972\">The Carey Treatment</a>.\" Did he have another good straight movie in him?

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>I'm trying to remember the last movie I saw that didn't end with a high school prom. \"Ravenous,'' maybe. Even the next film I saw, \"Never Been Kissed,'' ends with a prom. The high school romance genre has become so popular that it's running out of new ideas and has taken to recycling classic literature.</p><p>My colleague James Berardinelli made a list recently: \"Clueless'' was based on Emma, \"She's All That'' was inspired by \"Pygmalion'' and \"Cruel Intentions'' was recycled from \"Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' (prompting Stanley Kauffmann to observe that it was better back in the days when high school students were allowed to take over city government for a day, instead of remaking French novels). To this list we might also add the film update of \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-expectations-1998\">Great Expectations</a>\" (1998), Cinderella's true story in \"Ever After'' and \"Romeo + Juliet,'' which was anything but. There's even \"The Rage: Carrie 2''--a retread of \"Carrie,'' a work that in my opinion ranks right up there with the best of Austen, Shaw and Shakespeare.</p><p>\"10 Things I Hate About You'' is inspired, in a sortuva kinduva way, by Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew,'' in the same sense that \"Starship Troopers'' was inspired by \"Titus Andronicus.'' It doesn't remake Shakespeare so much as evoke him as a talisman, by setting its story at Padua High School, naming its characters Stratford and Verona, making one of the heroines a shrew, etc. There is even a scene where the shrew is assigned to rewrite a Shakespeare sonnet.</p><p>And yet ... gee, the movie is charming, despite its exhausted wheeze of an ancient recycled plot idea (boy takes bribe to ask girl to prom, then discovers that he really likes her--but then she finds out about the bribe and hates him). I haven't seen that idea in almost two months, since \"She's All That'' (boy makes bet he can turn plain wallflower into prom queen, and does, but falls in love with her, after which she discovers, etc., etc.).</p><p>The story this time involves two Seattle sisters. Bianca Stratford (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/larisa-oleynik\">Larisa Oleynik</a>) is popular and wears a lot of red dresses. Her shrewish older sister Katarina (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/julia-stiles\">Julia Stiles</a>) is unpopular, never dates and is the class brain. (When the English teacher asks his class for reactions to a Hemingway novel, she snaps, \"Hemingway was an alcoholic who hung around Picasso, hoping to nail his leftovers.'') Two guys want to take Bianca to the prom. One is shy and likable. The other is a blowhard. But Katarina's father (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/larry-miller\">Larry Miller</a>) has forbidden her to date until her older sister Kat starts going out. So they hatch a plot to persuade Patrick (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/heath-ledger\">Heath Ledger</a>), the school outlaw, to ask her to the prom. He takes a $300 bribe, but then realizes that Kat is actually quite lovely, etc., and really falls in love with her, after which, etc.</p><p>I think we simply have to dump the entire plot and appreciate the performances and some of the jolliest scenes. I liked the spirit of the high school teachers. <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/allison-janney\">Allison Janney</a> is the sex-mad counselor, and Daryl \"Chill'' Mitchell is the English teacher who performs Shakespeare's sonnets as if they were rap lyrics. (I've got news for you: They work pretty well as rap, and I expect the album any day.) I also liked the sweet, tentative feeling between Ledger and Stiles. He has a scene that brings the whole movie to an enjoyable halt. Trying to win her heart, he waits until she's on the athletic field, and then sings \"I love you baby'' over the P.A. system, having bribed the school's marching band to accompany him. Those scenes are worth the price of admission--almost. But then other scenes are a drag.</p><p>All teenage movies have at least one boring and endless party scene, in which everyone is wildly dressed, drunk and relentlessly colorful (in \"Never Been Kissed,'' some of the kids come as the Village People). These scenes inevitably involve (a) a fight, (b) barfing, and (c) a tearful romantic breakup in front of everybody. That scene was tedious, and so was a scene where the would-be lovers throw paint balloons at each other. I know there has to be a scene of carefree, colorful frolic, but as I watched them rubbing paint in each other's hair, I began to yearn for that old standby, the obligatory Tilt-a-Whirl ride.</p><p>I liked the movie's spirit, the actors and some of the scenes. The music, much of it by the band Letters to Cleo, is subtle and inventive while still cheerful. The movie almost but not quite achieves liftoff against the gravitational pull of the tired story formula. Sometimes it's a mistake to have acting this charming; the characters become so engaging and spontaneous, we notice how they're trapped in the plot.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>Even in the most routine Westerns, some sort of balance has to be struck between the shooting and the talking. Scenes of heroes and bad guys killing each other are all much alike. We watch for the official clichs like the guy who gets dragged by his horse, or the Indian crawling along the rooftop who is hit and throws his arms into the air, screaming \"Aiiee\" and all that. But unless a story has been introduced to make the shooting part of the plot, it can get pretty dreary. \"100 Rifles\" is pretty dreary.</p>\r<p>It has a larger percentage of action and a smaller percentage of talk than anything in this line since \"The Stranger Returns,\" which hardly seemed to employ a screenwriter at all. We get a succession of battles -- five, I think -- between a band of Mexican Indian revolutionaries and a pig-headed general.</p>\r<p><a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jim-brown\">Jim Brown</a> gets mixed up in it because he has come down from the States to arrest <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/burt-reynolds\">Burt Reynolds</a> for sticking up a bank. Reynolds is a bandito, and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/raquel-welch\">Raquel Welch</a> is his sidekick.</p>\r<p>Brown keeps saying he wants to return Reynolds to justice. If he does, he gets to keep the sheriff's job. But Reynolds tries to talk Brown into joining the revolution, and one warm evening when Miss Welch gets down to her knickers Brown decides it might be a passable idea at that.</p>\r<p>All this could be good fun, if director <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/tom-gries\">Tom Gries</a> had only made more of the characters. Brown and Reynolds are good together; Brown has a cool, humorous charm and Reynolds plays to it like the other half of a vaudeville team.</p>\r<p>Miss Welch, whose acting is not the issue here, tosses her hair contemptuously and poses with her hands on her hips. But that's about all that happens. The celebrated love scene between Brown and Raquel is as big a fizzle as that much-touted meeting between <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/sean-connery\">Sean Connery</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/brigitte-bardot\">Brigitte Bardot</a> in, \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/shalako-1968\">Shalako</a>.\"</p>\r<p>To compensate, Gries gives us lots of action. Too much action. He isn't really an action director (as demonstrated when a row of troops is mowed down by a machine gun and falls forward.) He thinks action consists of shots of Brown or Raquel shooting a gun, followed by shots of bad guys clutching their chests and toppling over.</p>\r<p>But action has to be directed so we can figure out what's going on. We want to follow the progress of the struggle and get a sense of danger. And we need to know the characters at least well enough to care about them. Without that, we might as well be watching Tom and Jerry.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>The thing about animation is that it gives equal time to kids and animals. They get to be important, too--the simplified world of cartoons cuts the adult world down to size. The problem with the new live-action version of 101 Dalmatians (based on the 1961 feature-length cartoon) is that it's never really able to make the dogs as important as the people. We think we'll see the adventures of some cute puppies, and most of the time we're looking at grown-up intrigues, and the schemes of a couple of bad guys recycled straight out of <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/home-alone-1990\">Home Alone</a>. Disney's new version of this good old story stars <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jeff-daniels\">Jeff Daniels</a> as a London-based computer game author named Roger; <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/joely-richardson\">Joely Richardson</a> as a dress designer named Anita, and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/glenn-close\">Glenn Close</a> as the steel-edged Cruella DeVil, who admits early in the film, sincerely but desperately, I worship fur. It is her only vice, but she makes it do the duty of a dozen.</p>\r<p>The movie tells a simple tale. Roger's male Dalmatian (Pongo) cruises St. James Park, falls in love with Anita's female Dalmatian (Perdy) and drags his master's bicycle on a wild chase that ends with Roger being splashed in the lagoon. As the dogs nuzzle happily, the eyes of the owners meet, and it is true love times two. The chemistry is sweet and convincing.</p>\r<p>Anita works for Cruella, who is not above using stolen pelts from murdered animals to adorn her high-fashion figure. Glenn Close is a skilled actress and looks right for Cruella (I like the touch of the gloves that have their own fingernails). She drives the snotty classic car, uses the long cigarette holder, strikes the flamboyant poses, and yet, somehow, she's only human. She isn't Cruella DeVil. No one of flesh and blood could be. If she's anyone, she's Norma Desmond from <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-sunset-boulevard-1950\">Sunset Boulevard</a>, playing Cruella DeVil.</p>\r<p>The plot, as you may recall from the earlier film, involves Pongo and Perdy having 15 puppies, which Cruella covets as part of her plan to design a new coat out of Dalmatian skins. The birth of the puppies leads to the one big laugh in the movie, as Cruella visits the newly wed Anita and Roger at home, Roger boasts We're having puppies, too! and Cruella responds, Puppies! You *have* been a busy boy. Cruella has two henchmen named Jasper (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/hugh-laurie\">Hugh Laurie</a>) and Horace (Mark Williams), who steal the pups and take them to her remote farmhouse, where she has 84 other puppies already in captivity. Then the barnyard animals help the pups escape, a kind of urban animal telegraph alerts Pongo and Perdy and their masters to the danger, and Jasper and Horace are subjected to a series of painful humiliations: electrocuted by fences, dumped off ladders, dunked in mud and other substances, bonked on the head, etc.</p>\r<p>Their exploits are recycled directly out of the adventures of the hapless thieves in the Home Alone movies, and indeed 101 Dalmatians was written by the creator of the Home Alone films, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/john-hughes\">John Hughes</a>. It would be unfair to make the link with Hughes if he didn't force it by ripping himself off so obviously that he might just as well have gone ahead and *cast* the Home Alone villains in this movie, and made an in-joke out of it. What's funny in cartoons is not always funny in live action, and some of the dunkings in unsavory substances left me less than amused. Slapstick is a much-overused and misunderstood art form.</p>\r<p>That's not to say the movie doesn't have its pleasures, and one of them is the unaffected, warm relationship between Roger and Anita (who looks so clean-cut, you suspect she smells of clean sheets). I know a lot of little kids who can't wait to see this movie, and no doubt the cute Dalmatian puppies will enthrall them.</p>\r<p>It is certainly more innocent and less angry than Jingle All the Way, and the kids will not be surprised to find that Cruella is a villain, while in the other film, they might be alarmed by the sight of several Santas puffing on cigars and planning scams. For older viewers, 101 Dalmatians may seem closer to the artistic level of the <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/beethoven-1992\">Beethoven</a> dog adventures than the mid-level Disney classic that inspired it. Hint: Don't wear your fur coat to the movie.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>All of Walt Disney's animated films have his signature on them, but 101 Dalmatians (1961) was one of the last to be made under his personal supervision. Seen 30 years later in a national re-release, it's an uneven film, with moments of inspiration in a fairly conventional tale of kidnapping and rescue. This is not one of the great Disney classics - it's not in the same league with Snow White or <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-pinocchio-1940\">Pinocchio</a> - but it's passable fun, and will entertain its target family audiences.</p>\r<p>The movie tells the story of two London dalmatians and their human owners - who they refer to as pets - and a villainess named Cruella De Vil, who wants to buy all the dalmatian puppies she can find in order to turn them into fur coats. When the hero and heroine produce a litter of 15 puppies, Cruella's appetite is whetted, and she hires a couple of thugs to kidnap them. The story continues in her ramshackle country mansion, where 99 puppies are eventually held for a date worse than death.</p>\r<p>The rescue attempt involves the adult dogs, as well as a brave cat and advice from various neighboring dogs. The big last scene is a chase down snowy roads in the middle of winter. And there are some cute touches, as when word of the missing dogs is sent all over London by doggie telegraph. But the story seems somewhat perfunctory, the chase scene is not as inventive as the climaxes of other Disney feature cartoons, and the animators never solve the problem of making the puppies seem different from one another.</p>\r<p>By the time the film was made, the golden days of full animation were already past. It was simply too expensive to animate every frame by hand, as Disney did in earlier days, and computer assistance was still in the future. In a film like 101 Dalmatians, you can see certain compromises, as when the foreground figures are fully animated but the backgrounds look static and sometimes one-dimensional. The strong point is in movement, and the animal figures have a nice three-dimensional reality to them, as in a scene where a puppy crawls under a blanket and tucks itself in.</p>\r<p>One sequence stands out from the others, as the puppies line up in front of the TV set to watch their favorite show, starring a brave dog. The interplay between the show and the pups is clever, and the TV show itself functions as a little added attraction; this is the first feature with the cartoon built in.</p>\r<p>If there's one thing that's absolutely first-rate about the film, it's the character of Cruella, with a voice by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/betty-lou-gerson\">Betty Lou Gerson</a>, who achieves almost operatic effects with her sudden entrances and exits, accompanied by clouds of yellow cigarette smoke. She's in a league with the Wicked Stepmother and the other great Disney villainesses - but the rest of the movie is more ordinary.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>Pavlov, you will recall, conditioned dogs to salivate at the ringing of a bell. It is only fitting that his namesake, a modern scientist in \"102 Dalmatians,\" is able to condition Cruella De Vil to feel affectionate when she sees a dog. As \"102 Dalmatians\" opens, the famous dognapper and fur enthusiast has been transformed into a dog lover by Dr. Pavlov's secret methods.</p><p>Released on probation, Cruella (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/glenn-close\">Glenn Close</a>) is assigned to a parole officer named Chloe (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/alice-evans\">Alice Evans</a>), who is a Dalmatian lover and doesn't believe Cruella has really been reformed. But Cruella seems to have turned over a new leaf and even gets involved in the activities of a shelter for homeless animals run by Kevin (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/ioan-gruffudd\">Ioan Gruffudd</a>), who has eyes for Chloe. Then, alas, a Pavlovian bell rings (it is no less than Big Ben), and Cruella reverts to type.</p><p>Such is the setup for \"102 Dalmatians,\" a movie in which it follows as the night does the day that Cruella sooner or later goes back to her old dog-hating ways. While the 1996 live-action version of \"101 Dalmatians\" had the original animated film to supply much of its story, this sequel is an original, with new characters, most memorably Monsieur Le Pelt (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/gerard-depardieu\">Gerard Depardieu</a>), a fur designer who wears a quasi-medieval costume influenced by Depardieu's recent film, \"Asterix\" (a huge hit in Europe, but never released in the States). There are also new dogs, including a puppy named Oddball, which is depressed, because it was born without spots.</p><p>I have here an urgent message from a dog lover urging me to emphasize in my review that Dalmatians are sensitive and demanding animals who require dedicated owners. The earlier Dalmatian films apparently inspired countless dog lovers to adopt Dalmatians they were not quite ready for, causing overbreeding and consequent homelessness; my correspondent will be happy to learn (1) the movie itself ends with a request that puppies be adopted only by owners prepared to be responsible and committed, and (2) if a movie hasn't yet driven you to acquire a Dalmatian, \"102 Dalmatians\" is unlikely to do the trick.</p><p>The film features formidable resources, including Cruella's home with its secret fur-storage rooms and dungeons. The good characters are portrayed as plucky and cheerful, the evil ones gnash their teeth more than the dogs, and Cruella's hairstyle, half black and half silver, is in itself a wonder, as are her hair, her nails and her bizarre makeup (the character is so seriously kinky I have always wondered what an R-rated version might have to offer us). It is a movie made with style and energy.</p><p>And yet whether you like it depends largely, I think, on how you feel about the dogs. Oddball is cute, yes, but he and the other dogs suffer somewhat because they are--well, real. The Disney animal classics, including \"Lady and the Tramp\" and the animated \"101 Dalmatians,\" were able to make their dogs into stars; in a live-action movie, they're reduced to supporting characters. Smaller children aren't likely to understand Cruella and Le Pelt, except as adults who are mean to dogs. There are some joys in chases and thrilling escapes, but taking the dogs out of the central roles leaves you with seriously weird humans and not enough puppy love.</p><p>Glenn Close does what can be done with the role. Indeed, she does more than can be done; Cruella is almost too big for a live-action film and requires animation to fit her operatic scale. The Le Pelt character is not really necessary, and although Chloe and Kevin (and Cruella's timid servant Alonso) do what they can, the film itself doesn't really seem necessary, either.</p><p>Yet Cruella De Vil has possibilities. I wonder why movies like this stay so close to their origins. Wouldn't it be intriguing to lift Cruella entirely out of dog roles and put her back into animation as the star of a cartoon version of \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-sunset-boulevard-1950\">Sunset Boulevard</a>\"? She's still big. It's live action that got small.</p>",

What lies at the end of this suicidal spending spree? <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/stephen-hawking\">Stephen Hawking</a> paints a future in which Earth resembles Venus, with a temperature of 482 degrees Fahrenheit. There would still be rain, however, although unfortunately of sulfuric acid.</p><p>Earth is cartwheeling out of balance. Did you know, as I learned in the new issue of <i>Discover</i> magazine, that while fish stocks disappear from the oceans, their place is being taken by an unimaginably huge explosion of jellyfish -- literally brainless creatures with a lifestyle consisting of eating? Sounds like us.</p><p>\"The 11th Hour,\" narrated and co-produced by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/leonardo-dicaprio\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>, gathers a group of respected experts to speak from their areas of knowledge about how we are despoiling our planet, and what we might possibly do to turn things around. We don't have much time. The architects John Todd and Bruce Mau explain how we could build \"green\" buildings that would use solar energy, consume their own waste and function much like a tree. There is no reason every home (every newly built one, for sure) would not have solar panels on the roof, to help heat, light and cool itself. Well, one reason, actually: The energy companies would resist any effect to redirect their own gargantuan subsidies toward eco-friendly homeowners.</p><p>We hear of the destruction of the forests, the death of the seas, the melting of the poles, the trapping of greenhouse gases. And in another forthcoming documentary, \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/in-the-shadow-of-the-moon-2007\">In the Shadow of the Moon</a>,\" about the surviving astronauts who walked on the moon, we see their view of Earth from 250,000 miles away; it strikes us what an awfully large planet this is to be wrapped in such a thin and vulnerable atmosphere.</p><p>All of this is necessary to know. But are we too selfish to do anything about it? Why isn't everybody buying a hybrid car? They can run for a year and pump less pollution into the atmosphere than a gallon of paint. They can get a third up to a half more fuel mileage. And here's the kicker: <i>They can go faster,</i> because they have two engines. So you ask people if they're getting a hybrid, and they squirm and say, gee, they dunno, they'd rather stick to the old way of going slower, spending more on gas and destroying the atmosphere. If booze companies advertise for responsible drinking and tobacco companies warn of health hazards, why don't gas companies ask you to buy a hybrid?</p><p>Some of these points are in \"The 11th Hour,\" others are offered by me, and the lesson is: We more or less know all this stuff, anyway. So does the movie motivate us to act on it? Not really. After I saw Al Gore's \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/an-inconvenient-truth-2006\">An Inconvenient Truth</a>,\" my next car was a hybrid. After seeing \"The 11th Hour,\" I'd be thinking more about my next movie.</p><p>The film sidesteps one of the oldest laws of television news and documentaries: <i>Write to the picture!</i> When Gore's film tells you something, it shows you what it's talking about. Too much of the footage of \"The 11th Hour\" is just standard nature photography, as helicopter-cams swoop over hill and dale and birds look unhappy and ice melts.</p><p>This is intercut with 50 experts, more or less, who talk and talk and talk. Even DiCaprio sounds like he's presenting a class project. They're all depicted as talking heads, so we see them talk, then get some nature footage, then see them talk some more, until finally we're thinking, enough already; I get it.</p><p>\"A bore,\" Meyer the hairy economist once told the private eye Travis McGee, \"is anyone who deprives you of solitude without providing you with companionship.\" This movie, for all its noble intentions, is a bore. Rent \"An Inconvenient Truth\" instead. Even if you've already seen it.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\">\"Twelve Angry Men\" remains a monument of American filmmaking, and more than 50 years after it was made, its story is still powerful enough to inspire this Russian version -- not a remake, but a new demonstration of a jury verdict arrived at only because one of the jurors was not angry so much as worried. \"12\" by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/nikita-mikhalkov\">Nikita Mikhalkov</a> is a powerful new film inspired by a powerful older one.</span><br></p><p>You know the story. A jury is sequestered. The men are hot and tired, and impatient to go home. It is assumed that the defendant, a young man accused of murder, is guilty. A quick vote is called for. The balloting shows 11 for convicting, one against. This generates a long and dogged debate in which the very principles of justice itself are called into play.</p><p>Perhaps Russia got this film when it needed it. Reginald Rose's original screenplay was written for the CBS drama showcase \"Studio One\" in 1954 and presented live. Franklin Schaffner (\"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-patton-1970\">Patton</a>\") was the director. The telecast took place during the declining days of the hearings held by Sen. Joseph McCarthy. CBS also broadcast the Army-McCarthy hearings, and Edward R. Murrow's historic takedown of the alcoholic witch hunter. The great film by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/sidney-lumet\">Sidney Lumet</a>, made in 1957, now stands at No. 9 on IMDb's poll of the greatest films, ahead of \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-empire-strikes-back-1997-1\">The Empire Strikes Back</a>\" and \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-casablanca-1942\">Casablanca</a>.\"</p><p>If the original story argued for the right to a fair trial in the time of McCarthy's character assassinations, the Russian version comes at a time when that nation is using the jury system after a legacy of Stalinist purges and Communist party show trials. It also dramatizes anti-Semitism and hatred for Chechens; the youth on trial is newly arrived in Moscow. The issue of overnight Russian millionaires in a land of much poverty is also on many of the jurors' minds.</p><p>None of the jurors is given a name, although director Mikhalkov gives himself the role of the jury foreman. One by one, every member of the jury tells a story or reveals a secret. Their set-pieces do the job of swaying fellow jurors to reconsider their votes but are effective on their own as essentially a series of one-man shows. There is not a weak member in the cast, and it's a tribute to the power of the actors that the 2-hour running time doesn't seem labored. The jury is sequestered in the gymnasium of a school next to the courtroom, and they never leave it, but their stories are performed so skillfully that in our minds, we envision many settings; they're like radio plays.</p><p>Lumet famously began his film with the camera above eye level and subtly lowered it until at the end, when the characters loomed above the camera. Mikhalkov, with a large open space to work with, uses camera placement and movement instead, circling the makeshift jury table and following jurors as they wander the room. A sparrow flies in through a window, and its fluttering and chirping is a reminder that the jurors, too, feel imprisoned.</p><p> Going in, I knew what the story was about, how it would progress and how it would end. Mikhalkov keeps all of that (writer Rose shares a screen credit), but he has made a new film with its own original characters and stories, and after all, it's not how the film ends, but how it gets there.</p>",

        "Terry Gilliam"
    ],
    "formatted_review_text": "<p>Terry Gilliam's ambitious \"12 Monkeys\" was co-authored by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/david-peoples\">David Peoples</a>, who wrote \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/blade-runner-1982-1\">Blade Runner</a>,\" and it has the same view of the near future as a grunge pit - a view it shares with Gilliam's own \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/brazil-1986\">Brazil</a>.\" In this world, everything is rusty, subterranean, and leaks. The movie uses its future world as a home base and launching pad for the central story, which is set in 1990 and 1996, and is about a time traveler trying to save the world from a deadly plague.</p>\r<p>The traveler is Cole (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/bruce-willis\">Bruce Willis</a>), who in the opening shots lives with a handful of other human survivors in an underground shelter put together out of scrap parts and a lot of wire mesh. The surface of the planet has been reclaimed by animals, after the death of 5 billion people during a plague in 1996.</p>\r<p>Cole is plucked from his cage and sent on a surface expedition by the rulers of this domain, who hope to learn enough about the plague virus to defeat it. Later, he is picked for a more crucial mission: He will travel back in time and gather information about the virus before it mutated. (The movie holds out no hope that he can \"stop\" it before it starts; from his point of view, the plague has already happened, and so the future society is seeking treatment, not prevention.) Cole lands in 1990, bruised, bleeding, and dripping sweat and mucus from every pore (a large percentage of Bruce Willis' film career has been spent in this condition). He's thrown in jail, and assigned a psychiatrist, Dr. Kathryn Railly (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/madeleine-stowe\">Madeleine Stowe</a>), who believes he's delusional when he says he's a visitor from the future (\"You won't think I'm crazy when people start dying next month\"). He pulls off an inexplicable jail break and reappears in her life in 1996, kidnapping her because he needs help in finding 12 monkeys in Philadelphia that have the virus in its \"pure\" form before it mutated, later that year, into a killer of humans.</p>\r<p>Cole discovers that a mental patient named Jeffrey Goines (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/brad-pitt\">Brad Pitt</a>), whom he met in 1990, is an animal rights activist with a father (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/christopher-plummer\">Christopher Plummer</a>) whose laboratory may be harboring the deadly virus. Does Jeffrey want to unleash the virus, returning the earth to the animals? Or does his father, or another member of the team . . .</p>\r<p>All of this is just the plumbing of the plot. What the movie is really about is its vision. The decor looks cobbled together from the debris of the 20th century. Cities are either scabby Skid Rows or towering skyscrapers. Scientists still work in laboratories that look like old postcards of Thomas Edison inventing. Bizarre killers and villains are hurled at Cole and Railly, and there are many bloody fights. Gradually the psychiatrist comes to believe, after Cole makes a series of accurate predictions, that he may be from the future after all.</p>\r<p>The movie is not, however, a straightforward action thriller.</p>\r<p>Much of the interest comes from the nature of the Cole character. He is simple, confused, badly informed, exhausted and shot through with feelings of betrayal. Nothing is as it seems - not in his future world, not in 1990 and not in 1996. And there is another factor, one hinted at in the opening shot of the movie and confirmed in the closing: He may have already witnessed the end of the story.</p>\r<p>The plot of \"12 Monkeys,\" if you follow it closely, involves a time travel paradox. Almost all time travel movies do. But who cares? What's good about the film is the way Gilliam, his actors and his craftsmen create a universe that is contained within 130 minutes.</p>\r<p>There are relatively few shots in this movie that would look normal in any other film; everything is skewed to express the vision.</p>\r<p>Gilliam's \"Brazil\" was praised by a lot of critics, but I didn't get it, even after repeated viewings. \"12 Monkeys\" is easier to follow, with a plot that holds together and a solid relationship between Cole and Railly. But even here, Gilliam allows the anarchic flywheel of madness to spin: The Brad Pitt character, spewing compulsive visions of paranoia and dread, is a powerful influence, suggesting that logic cannot solve the movie's problems. And other characters - those in charge of the subterranean future world, as well as the conspirators around the Plummer character - behave like villains pumped in from an H.G. Wells science-fiction fantasy. Wild overacting takes place on bizarre sets that are photographed with tilt shots and wideangle lenses, and we begin to share the confusion and exhaustion of Cole. Like him, we're wrenched back and forth through time, and dumped on the concrete floor of reality.</p>\r<p>One of the most intriguing sequences is completely arbitrary.</p>\r<p>Cole and the woman hide out in a movie theater playing Hitchcock's \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-vertigo-1958\">Vertigo</a>,\" and later, in their own lives, replay the movie's key scene, with the same music on the soundtrack. What is Gilliam doing here? He's not simply providing a movie in-joke. The point, I think, is that Cole's own life is caught between rewind and fast-forward, and he finds himself repeating in the past what he learned in the future, and vice versa.</p>\r<p>I've seen \"12 Monkeys\" described as a comedy. Any laughs that it inspires will be very hollow. It's more of a celebration of madness and doom, with a hero who tries to prevail against the chaos of his condition, and is inadequate. This vision is a cold, dark, damp one, and even the romance between Willis and Stowe feels desperate rather than joyous. All of this is done very well, and the more you know about movies (especially the technical side), the more you're likely to admire it. But a comedy it's not. And as an entertainment, it appeals more to the mind than to the senses.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\">Sometimes a person will make an enormous mistake and get a lot of time to think about it. There was a man who went over Niagara Falls sealed inside a big rubber ball. It never made it to the bottom. The ball lodged somewhere on the way down. He'd counted on his team to cut him out after he landed. Oops! Aron Ralston, the hero of \"127 Hours,\" had an oops! moment. That's even what he calls it. He went hiking in the wilderness without telling anyone where he was going, and then in a deep, narrow crevice, got his forearm trapped between a boulder and the canyon wall. Oops.</span><br></p><p>We all heard about this. Ralston stumbled out to safety more than five days later, having cut off his own right arm to escape. He is an upbeat and resilient person and has returned to rock climbing, although now, I trust, after filing a plan, going with a companion and not leaving his Swiss Army Knife behind. The knife would have been ever so much more convenient than his multipurpose tool. I imagine that every time he considers his missing right forearm, he feels that under the circumstances he's better off without it.</p><p>What would you have done? What about me? I don't know if I could have done it. It involves a gruesome ordeal for Ralston, and for the film's audience, a few of whom have been said to faint. But from such harrowing beginnings, it's rather awesome what an entertaining film <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/danny-boyle\">Danny Boyle</a> has made with \"127 Hours.\" Yes, entertaining.</p><p>For most of the film he deals with one location and one actor, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/james-franco\">James Franco</a>. There's a carefree prologue in which Ralston and a couple of young woman hikers have a swim in an underwater cavern. Later, during moments of hallucination, other people from his life seem to visit. But the fundamental reality is expressed in the title of the book he wrote about his experience: Between a Rock and a Hard Place.</p><p>Franco does a good job of suggesting two aspects of Ralston's character. (1) He's a cocky, bold adventurer who trusts his skills and likes taking chances, and (2) he's logical and bloody-minded enough to cut through his own skin and bone to save his life. One aspect gets him into his problem, and the other gets him out.</p><p>Is the film watchable? Yes, compulsively. Films like this don't move quickly or slowly, they seem to take place all in the same moment. They prey on our own deep fear of being trapped somewhere and understanding that there doesn't seem to be any way to escape. Edgar Allan Poe mined this vein in several different ways. Ralston is at least fortunate to be standing on a secure foothold; one can imagine the boulder falling and leaving him dangling in mid-air from the trapped arm. </p><p>Suddenly, his world has become very well-defined. There is the crevice. There is the strip of sky above, crossed by an eagle on its regular flight path. There are the things he brought with him: a video camera, some water, a little food, his inadequate little tool. It doesn't take long to make an inventory. He shouts for help, but who can hear? The two women campers have long since gone their way and won't report him missing because they won't realize that he is. For anyone to happen to find him is unthinkable. He will die or do something.</p><p>\"127 Hours\" is like an exercise in conquering the unfilmable. Boyle uses magnificent cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle and Enrique Chediak, establishing the vastness of the Utah wilderness, and the very specific details of Ralston's small portion of it. His editor, Jon Harris, achieves the delicate task of showing an arm being cut through without ever quite showing it. For the audience the worst moment is not a sight but a sound. Most of us have never heard that sound before, but we know exactly what it is.</p><p>Pain and bloodshed are so common in the movies. They are rarely amped up to the level of reality, because we want to be entertained, not sickened. We and the heroes feel immune. \"127 Hours\" removes the filters. It implicates us. By identification, we are trapped in the canyon, we are cutting into our own flesh. One element that film can suggest but not evoke is the brutality of the pain involved. I can't even imagine what it felt like. Maybe that made it easier for Ralston, because in one way or another, his decision limited the duration of his suffering.</p><p>He must be quite a man. The film deliberately doesn't make him a hero  more of a capable athlete trapped by a momentary decision. He cuts off his arm because he has to. He was lucky to succeed. One can imagine a news story of his body being discovered long afterward, with his arm only partly cut through. He did what he had to do, which doesn't make him a hero. We could do it, too. Oh, yes, we could.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>\"13 Assassins\" has what many action pictures need, a villain who transcends evil and ascends to a realm of barbaric madness. Against this creature and his private army, a band of samurai is mustered to end his terror. Their heroism against impossible odds is a last hurrah for the samurai code; the film is set in 1844, toward the end of the medieval Edo period, when true samurai warriors were growing rare.</p><p>The film is terrifically entertaining, an ambitious big-budget epic, directed with great visuals and sound by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/takeshi-miike\">Takeshi Miike</a>. The last 45 minutes are devoted to an inventive and ingenious battle scene, but it's not the sort of incomprehensible mayhem we often find in recent actioners. It's a lesson to the queasy-cam auteurs, because Miike choreographs the action to make it comprehensible  and, more important, has spent his first two acts establishing the characters. We know who the 13 samurai are, and we understand why many of them behave as they do under threat of death. The care taken with the screenplay and the shot composition deserves comparison with Kurosawa's (even better) \"Seven Samurai.\"</p><p>The film opens with stark, bloody simplicity. A man kneels in a courtyard and disembowels himself in protest against Lord Naritsugu (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/goro-inagaki\">Goro Inagaki</a>), the half-brother of the shogun. This seppuku was inspired by Naritsugu's cruelty, which we see demonstrated in appalling detail. He amputates some victims, kicks the severed heads of others across rooms and exercises the right to rape anyone in his domain. He isn't a twisted caricature, but a preening narcissist; the shogun inexplicably plans to promote him.</p><p>To correct this evil in the land, Sir Doi (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/mikijiro-hira\">Mikijiro Hira</a>) seeks the samurai Shimada (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/koji-yakusho\">Koji Yakusho</a>) and finds him peacefully fishing atop a ladder in the sea  but with his sword of course nearby. Shimada then seeks another dozen warriors to join him, and this process is familiar to us from countless other movies. Each of the recruits has his own personality and back story, some more elaborate than others, and of course there must be a little comic relief, although Koyata (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/yusuke-iseya\">Yusuke Iseya</a>) grows more serious in the heat of battle.</p><p>The odds for these heroes seem impossible; they are only 13 and Lord Naritsugu fields at least 200 against them. Miike spares us the whimsy that 13 good men can defeat 200 evil ones, and has his samurai rig an entire village as a trap. It's clear this is planned, but the details remain vague, and when the surprises begin, it would be logical, I think, to ask exactly how the assassins found the time and resources to marshal such an elaborate ambush. Logical, but not fair; you don't ask questions like that in movies that require your belief.</p><p>Samurai films have a rich history, and Miike evokes it elegantly with traditional costumes, idealistic dialogue, sharp characterizations, and a gloriously choreographed fight sequence that must extend in one form or another for 40 minutes. I often find fight scenes in movies boring, because they substitute movement for drama. But in \"13 Assassins,\" characters are involved who we know and understand, and the general melee is broken down into structured vignettes. Hollywood action directors could study this film, especially in the way it focuses on story in the midst of violence.</p><p>There is a subtext in the film. The 13 assassins are essentially making a last stand for the traditional samurai code. Modern times are encroaching on Japan, and the shogunate is corrupt, decadent and a hive of nepotism. I was reminded in a lateral way of Yamata's \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/twilight-samurai-2004\">Twilight Samurai</a>\" (2004), a very good film set in 1868, about a samurai who works for his clan as an accountant, and is forced to recall the code of his tradition.</p><p>While watching \"13 Assassins,\" I was sure CGI effects must have been used, but I was rarely able to notice them. That's the point, as it always was in traditional special effects: to deceive the eye, not insult it. Most of the movement here is at least somewhat plausible in terms of the real world. Too often CGI is an excuse for what amounts to live-action cartoons. Here is a film that could be studied for its lessons by the manufacturers of Friday night action blockbusters.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>Happiness is the subject of \"13 Conversations About One Thing.\" For that matter, happiness is the subject of every conversation we ever have: the search for happiness, the envy of happiness, the loss of happiness, the guilt about undeserved happiness. The engine that drives the human personality is our desire to be happy instead of sad, entertained instead of bored, inspired instead of disillusioned, informed rather than ignorant. It is not an easy business.</p><p>Consider Troy (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/matthew-mcconaughey\">Matthew <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/mcconaughey\">McConaughey</a></a>), the prosecutor who has just won a big conviction. In the movie's opening scene, he's loud and obnoxious in a saloon, celebrating his victory. He spots a sad-sack at the bar: Gene (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/alan-arkin\">Alan Arkin</a>), who seems to be pessimistic about the possibility of happiness. Gene is a mid-level manager at an insurance company, has to fire someone, and decides to fire Wade, the happiest man in the department, since he can see the sunny side of anything.</p><p>Troy buys drinks for Gene. He wants everybody to be happy. Then he drives drunk, hits a pedestrian with his car and believes he has killed her. As an assistant district attorney he knows how much trouble he's in and instinctively leaves the scene. His problem becomes an all-consuming guilt, which spoils his ability to enjoy anything in life; he was cut in the accident, and keeps the wound open with a razor blade, to punish himself.</p><p>The movie finds connections between people who think they are strangers, finding the answer to one person's problem in the question raised by another. We meet Walker (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/john-turturro\">John Turturro</a>), a sardonic college professor, who walks out on his wife (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/amy-irving\">Amy Irving</a>) and begins an affair with a woman (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/barbara-sukowa\">Barbara Sukowa</a>). She realizes that the affair is hardly the point: Walker is going through the motions because he has been told, and believes, that this is how you find happiness. We also meet a house cleaner (Clea DuVall) who is good at her job but works for a client who can only criticize. She is injured for no reason at all, suffers great pain, does not deserve to.</p><p>The truth hidden below the surface of the story is a hard one: Nothing makes any sense. We do not get what we deserve. If we are lucky, we get more. If we are unlucky, we get less. Bad things happen to good people and good things happen to bad people. That's the system. All of our philosophies are a futile attempt to explain it. Let me tell you a story. Not long ago, I was in the middle of a cheerful conversation when I slipped on wet wax, landed hard, and broke bones in my left shoulder. I was in a fool's paradise of happiness, you see, not realizing that I was working without a net--that in a second my happiness would be rudely interrupted.</p><p>I could have hit my head and been killed. Or landed better and not been injured. At best, what we can hope for is a daily reprieve from all of the things that can go wrong. \"13 Conversations About One Thing\" is relentless in the way it demonstrates how little we control our lives. We can choose actions but we cannot plan outcomes. Follow, for example, the consequences of Arkin's decision to fire the happy man, and then see what happens to Arkin, and then see what happens to the happy man. Or watch as the McConaughey character grants reality to something he only thinks he knows. Or see how the Turturro character, so obsessed with his personal timetable, so devoted to his daily and weekly routines, is able to arrange everything to his satisfaction--and then is not satisfied.</p><p>The movie is brilliant, really. It is philosophy, illustrated through everyday events. Most movies operate as if their events are necessary--that B must follow A. \"13 Conversations\" betrays B, A and all the other letters as random possibilities.</p><p>The film was directed by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jill-sprecher\">Jill Sprecher</a> and written with her sister, Karen. It's their second, after \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/clockwatchers-1998\">Clockwatchers</a>\" (1997), the lacerating, funny story about temporary workers in an office and their strategies to prove they exist in a world that is utterly indifferent to them. After these two movies, there aren't many filmmakers whose next film I anticipate more eagerly. They're onto something. They're using films to demonstrate something to us. Movies tell narratives, and the purpose of narrative is to arrange events in an order that seems to make sense and end correctly. The Sprechers are telling us if we believe in these narratives, we're only fooling ourselves.</p><p>And yet, even so, there is a way to find happiness. That is to be curious about all of the interlocking events that add up to our lives. To notice connections. To be amused or perhaps frightened by the ways things work out. If the universe is indifferent, what a consolation that we are not.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>\"13 Ghosts\" is the loudest movie since ''Armageddon.'' Flash frames attack the eyeballs while the theater trembles with crashes, bangs, shatters, screams, rumbles and roars. Forget about fighting the ghosts; they ought to attack the sub-woofer.</p><p>The experience of watching the film is literally painful. It hurts the eyes and ears. Aware that their story was thin, that their characters were constantly retracing the same ground and repeating the same words, that the choppy editing is visually incoherent, maybe the filmmakers thought if they turned up the volume the audience might be deceived into thinking that something was happening.</p><p>When the action pauses long enough for us to see what's on the screen, we have to admire the art direction, special effects, costumes and makeup. This is a movie that is all craft and little art. It mostly takes place inside a house that is one of the best-looking horror sets I've seen, and the 12 ghosts look like pages from Heavy Metal, brought to grotesque life. (The 13th ghost is, of course, the key to the mystery.) The screenplay, inspired by the 1960 <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/william-castle\">William Castle</a> film of the same name but written in a zone all its own, involves dead Uncle Cyrus (F. Murray Abraham), whose researches into the occult included a medieval manuscript allegedly dictated by the devil. He leaves his house to his nephew Arthur (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/tony-shalhoub\">Tony Shalhoub</a>), whose wife has tragically died; Arthur moves in with his son Bobby (Alec Roberts), his daughter Kathy (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/shannon-elizabeth\">Shannon Elizabeth</a>) and Maggie the nanny (Rah Digga). They're joined by a wise-cracking ghostbuster named Rafkin (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/matthew-lillard\">Matthew Lillard</a>) and Kalina (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/embeth-davidtz\">Embeth Davidtz</a>), a paranormal who knows a lot about Uncle Cyrus, his research, and how the house works.</p><p>And does it ever work. Exterior steel panels slide up and down, revealing glass container-cages inside which hold the 12 invisible ghosts, which Cyrus needed in order to ... oh, never mind. What intrigues me is that this house, its shrieks of terror and its moving walls attract no attention at all from the neighbors, even late in the film when truly alarming things are happening. Maybe the neighbors read the screenplay.</p><p>The shatterproof glass cages, we learn, are engraved with ''containment spells'' that keep the ghosts inside. You can see the ghosts with special glasses, which the cast is issued; when they see them, we see them, usually in shots so maddeningly brief we don't get a good look. Our consolation, I guess, is that the cast has the glasses but we will have the pause button when ''13 Ghosts'' comes out on DVD. The only button this movie needs more than pause is delete.</p><p>The house, Kalina explains, is really an infernal device: ''We are in the middle of a machine designed by the devil and powered by the dead.'' Gears grind and levers smash up and down, looking really neat, and wheels turn within wheels as it's revealed that the purpose of this machine is to open the ''Oculorus Infernum.'' When a character asks, ''What's that?'' the answer is not helpful: ''It's Latin.'' Later we learn it is the Eye of Hell, and ... oh, never mind.</p><p>If there are 12 ghosts there must, I suppose, be 12 containment cages, and yet when little Bobby wanders off to the subterranean area with the cages, he gets lost, and his father, sister, the nanny, the psychic and the ghostbuster wander endlessly up and down what must be the same few corridors, shouting ''Bobby! Bobby?'' so very, very, very many times that I wanted to cheer when Rafkin finally said what we had all been thinking: ''Screw the kid! We gotta get out of this basement!'' The production is first-rate; the executives included <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/joel-silver\">Joel Silver</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/robert-zemeckis\">Robert Zemeckis</a>. The physical look of the picture is splendid. The screenplay is dead on arrival. The noise level is torture. I hope \"13 Ghosts\" plays mostly at multiplexes, because it's the kind of movie you want to watch from the next theater.</p>",

The director, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/gary-winick\">Gary Winick</a>, came out of Sundance with \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/tadpole-2002\">Tadpole</a>\" (2003), a movie in which a 16-year-old boy was seduced by a 40-year-old woman, and some of us wondered how well that plot would have worked with a 16-year-old girl and a 40-year-old man. Now Winick finds out, by supplying a 13-year-old girl with a 30-year-old body and a boyfriend who's a professional hockey star. Their big makeout scene goes wrong when she thinks he's \"gross,\" and we fade to black, mercifully, before we find out what happens then. Can you be guilty of statutory rape caused by magical body-switching?</p><p>The movie introduces us to Jenna Rink when she's a teenager (played by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/christa-b-allen\">Christa B. Allen</a>), who allows the most popular girls in school to push her around because she wants to be just like them. (There's a much superior version of this angle in \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mean-girls-2004\">Mean Girls</a>,\" which opens next week.) She throws a party in her rec room and the girls play a nasty trick on her, which inspires her to be cruel to her only true friend, Matt, a chubby kid who lives next door and adores her.</p><p>Then she's sprinkled with magic dust (I think we have to let the movie get away with this), and discovers that she is 30, lives in New York, is an editor of a magazine named Poise, and looks like Jennifer Garner. Her snotty high school classmate Lucy (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/judy-greer\">Judy Greer</a>) now works with her on the magazine, and they're friends, sort of, although the movie teaches us that career women will betray each other to get ahead.</p><p>In the best examples of this genre, there are funny scenes in which adult actors get to act as if they're inhabited by kids. <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/tom-hanks\">Tom Hanks</a> did this about as well as it can be done in \"Big,\" and I also liked <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/judge-reinhold\">Judge Reinhold</a> in \"Vice Versa\" and of course <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jamie-lee-curtis\">Jamie Lee Curtis</a> in the 2003 version of \"Freaky Friday.\" Strangely, \"13 Going on 30\" doesn't linger on scenes like that, maybe because Jenna is established in a high-powered Manhattan world where she has to learn fast. The result is that most of the movie isn't really about a 13-year-old in an adult body, but about a power struggle at the magazine, and Jenna's attempts to renew her friendship with Matt (now played by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/mark-ruffalo\">Mark Ruffalo</a>).</p><p>He's not cooperative. Apparently her missing 17 years all actually occurred; it's just that she can't remember them. And after the disastrous party in the rec room, she never talked to Matt again, so why should he believe she's any different now? She's desperate, because she has no real friends, but Matt is engaged to be married, and what happens to the time line to solve that dilemma would make \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/eternal-sunshine-of-the-spotless-mind-2004-1\">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</a>\" look as linear as a <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/doris-day\">Doris Day</a> romance.</p><p>Logical quibbles are of course irrelevant with a movie like this. You buy the magic because it comes with the territory. What I couldn't buy was the world of the magazine office, and the awkward scenes in which high-powered professionals don't seem to notice that they're dealing with a 13-year-old mind. Jenna's bright idea to redesign the magazine is so spectacularly bad that it's accepted, I suppose, only because the screenwriters stood over the actors with whips and drove them to it.</p><p>The writers, by the way, are <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/cathy-yuspa\">Cathy Yuspa</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/josh-goldsmith\">Josh Goldsmith</a>, the same duo that wrote the vastly superior office comedy \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/what-women-want-2000\">What Women Want</a>\" (2000), in which <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/mel-gibson\">Mel Gibson</a> was able to read the minds of the women in his office. This time there are no minds worth reading. Although we understand why Jenna is attracted to the adult Matt (who has undergone a transition from pudgy to handsome), the movie never really deals with (1) Whether he fully comes to grips with the fact that this is the <i>same</i> girl he knew at 13, and (2) how or why or whether or when a 13-year-old can successfully fall in love with a 30-year-old man, with everything that would entail (in life, anyway, if not in this movie). There are so many emotional and sexual puzzles to tap-dance around, this should have been a musical.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>Arriving at last more than a year after it was completed, \"The 13th Warrior\" shows every sign of a production run amok. With a budget said to be more than $100 million, it displays a lot of cash on the screen, but little thought. To extract the story from the endless scenes of action and carnage is more effort than it's worth. The film seems to have been conceived from the special effects on down. Instead of beginning with a good story and then adding f/x as needed, it apparently began with f/x and then the story was shoehorned into the pauses in the action.</p><p>It could have been different. This could, indeed, have been a fascinating tale. Based on Eaters of the Dead, a 1974 novel by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/michael-crichton\">Michael Crichton</a>, the story combines two intriguing sources. One is the real-life adventure of Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan, an Arab poet who traveled north to the Viking lands in the 10th century. The other is the Old English epic poem Beowulf. At some point early in the production, it was apparently determined that endless scenes of long-haired Vikings in sword fights would be more interesting than the telling of these stories.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/antonio-banderas\">Antonio Banderas</a>, perhaps hoping for another swashbuckling success like \"The Mask Of Zorro,\" stars as Ahmed, a poet who has the misfortune to fall in love with his king's wife. Threatened with dire consequences, Ahmed, advised by a veteran courtier (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/omar-sharif\">Omar Sharif</a> in a cameo), prudently travels north as an ambassador to the Vikings, where he is seen as a curiosity and a challenge. The Norsemen cheerfully insult him, confident he doesn't understand them, but a montage shows him learning the language and startling them with his reply. Soon he's called upon to recite a poem at a funeral, a scene that develops inadvertently into a hilarious version of history's first poetry slam.</p><p>Times are tough for the Vikings. A mysterious tribe of enemies, who believe they possess the spirits of bears, present a flesh-eating threat. They have returned, as I recall, from ancient times. Thirteen warriors must be chosen to fight the evil. Ahmed is of course destined to be the 13th. He's a poet, not a fighter, but quickly learns to wield a broadsword.</p><p>And that's about it, except for miles and miles of carnage. (It's a little unsettling to sit through nonstop slaughter and then witness a pious conclusion that celebrates \"a useful servant of God.\") The movie's director of record is <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/john-mctiernan\">John McTiernan</a> (\"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/die-hard-1988\">Die Hard</a>,\" \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-thomas-crown-affair-1999\">The Thomas Crown Affair</a>\"), although after an earlier version of the film performed badly in sneak previews, new scenes were reportedly shot under the direction of Crichton. It's all to no avail: \"The 13th Warrior\" is another example of f/x run wild, lumbering from one expensive set-piece to the next without taking the time to tell a story that might make us care.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p><a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/ridley-scott\">Ridley Scott</a>'s \"1492: Conquest of Paradise\" sees Christopher Columbus as more complex and humane than in the other screen treatments of the character. His Columbus is an enlightened revision of the traditional figure, treating Indians the same as Spanish noblemen and seeming content with the notion that nature, not the Catholic God, is their deity.</p><p>Columbus is also a good deal more convincing as a human being. As played by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/gerard-depardieu\">Gerard Depardieu</a>, he seems huge and shaggy and dogged, just the kind of man who would get an idea in his head and refuse to surrender it. We are familiar with many of the stages in his story, such as his defense of his voyage before hostile scholars, and his careful courting of Queen Isabella as his patron, but Depardieu makes them seem new.</p><p>That is even true of the inevitable scene in which Columbus uses a piece of fruit to illustrate his belief that the world is round. This time it is an orange. In the dreary \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/christopher-columbus-the-discovery-1992\">Christopher Columbus: The Discovery</a>,\" released last August, it was an apple. I am waiting for someone to make it a potato, since Europe before the discovery of America had no potatoes - a fact I have been husbanding for years in case I am ever a guest on \"Jeopardy.\" What disappoints me a little about Scott's version is that he seems to hurry past Columbus' actual voyage of discovery. There is intrigue in the Old World and adventure and violence in the New, but the crucial journey that links them seems reduced to its simplest terms: The three ships sail, the crews grow restless, there is mutiny in the air, Columbus quiets it, and then land is sighted. (In the previous film version, Columbus helpfully offered to be beheaded if land was not sighted in three days, an embellishment of history that Scott and screenwriter Roselyne Bosch wisely omit.) The theory that the world was round was held in intelligent circles long before Columbus was born, and ships capable of sailing across the Atlantic had been available for a long time (Europeans were already rounding Africa on their way to Asia, and the Vikings preceded Columbus to North America by centuries). What prevented Europe from expanding into the new continent was essentially superstition and conservatism, a strong impulse to leave things as they were. It was an impulse that Columbus was constitutionally unable to accept.</p><p>Ridley Scott is a visually oriented director who finds great beauty in his vision of the New World, including a breathtaking shot in which the ocean mists rise to reveal a verdant shore. He shot his film in Costa Rica, where the Native Americans are depicted as dignified and gentle, people who inspire Columbus to wonder whether they might not be an improvement on the inbred backbiting nobles of the Spanish court. I am not convinced that Columbus was as enlightened as he seems in this movie, but perhaps historical figures exist in order to be reinterpreted every so often in terms of current needs.</p><p>The screenplay is the result of extended research by Bosch (who nevertheless observes in the film's notes that Catholics in Isabella's Spain could be burned at the stake for eating meat on \"Holy Friday\"). She continues Columbus' story for a decade after his discovery of America, as he brings news of his triumph back to Spain, returns to the New World as a viceroy, and then struggles with the land, violent noblemen, opponents in Spain and even a hurricane before being returned in disgrace to prison. There is a happy ending; Isabella grants his wish to visit the American mainland, and he dies after dictating his memoirs to his son.</p><p>One of Depardieu's most touching moments is a closeup as he hears his fellow Italian Amerigo Vespucci described as the discoverer of the mainland, although here the movie plays fast and loose with the facts, since Columbus, who visited South America before Vespucci did, is given a sad line in which he asks how much further it was (and \"America\" was not named after Vespucci until the year after Columbus's death).</p><p>What I would someday like to see would be a film much closer to the bone than this one, one in which the physical rigors of the voyage and the first settlements were depicted more realistically.</p><p>Scott's version is particularly handicapped by a score by Vangelis which alternates between breathless angelic choirs and brooding jungle music. The sound track instructs us what to think about many of the shots; the quasi-ecclesiastical strains seem to suggest the church will indeed save many souls in the New World, while the Indian theme suggests that these simple forest people were already well on the way to inventing New Age music.</p><p>Still, in its own way and up to a certain point, \"1492\" is a satisfactory film. Depardieu lends it gravity, the supporting performances are convincing, the locations are realistic, and we are inspired to reflect that it did indeed take a certain nerve to sail off into nowhere just because an orange was round.</p>",

Two creeps videotape themselves committing murder, and then attempt to sell the video to a reality news show for $1 million. They plan to beat the murder charges with an insanity plea, adding that they were abused as children.</p><p>I think it is possible. I heard about a documentary at Sundance this year where a fraternity boy videotaped his friend in a sex act that the woman claimed was rape. The video, later released to the press by law enforcement officials, is included in the documentary, so you can decide for yourself.</p><p>What kind of person would do something like that? (I refer both to the fictional murder plot of \"15 Minutes\" and to the actual rape footage.) The kind of person, I imagine, who appears on \"The <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jerry-springer\">Jerry Springer</a> Show,\" a program I study for signposts on our society's descent into barbarism. When you say these people have no shame, you have to realize that \"shame\" is a concept and perhaps even a word with which they are not familiar. They will eagerly degrade themselves for the 15 minutes of fame so famously promised them by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/andy-warhol\">Andy Warhol</a>.</p><p>\"15 Minutes\" is a cynical, savage satire about violence, the media and depravity. It doesn't have the polish of \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/natural-born-killers-1994\">Natural Born Killers</a>\" or the wit of \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/wag-the-dog-1998\">Wag the Dog</a>,\" but it's a real movie, rough edges and all, and not another link from the sausage factory. A couple of the early reviews have called it implausible. They doubt that real killers would sell their footage to TV and then watch it in a Planet Hollywood, hoping to be spotted and arrested. See, that's the funny thing. I think there are people who would.</p><p>The movie stars <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/robert-de-niro\">Robert De Niro</a> as a Manhattan detective who has become a celebrity, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/edward-burns\">Edward Burns</a> as a fire inspector, and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/kelsey-grammer\">Kelsey Grammer</a> as a cross between Springer and Geraldo Rivera. Working the other side of the street are <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/karel-roden\">Karel Roden</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/oleg-taktarov\">Oleg Taktarov</a> as Emil and Oleg, one Czech, one Russian, who fly into Kennedy Airport and are robbing an electronics store within hours of getting off the plane. Emil dreams of becoming rich and famous through violence, and Oleg videotapes his efforts--at first just for fun, later as part of a scheme. Emil loves America because \"no one is responsible for what they do!\" and Oleg idolizes <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/frank-capra\">Frank Capra</a>, the poet of the little man who shoves it to the system.</p><p>The movie, written and directed by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/john-herzfeld\">John Herzfeld</a>, is the work of a man intoxicated by characters and locations. His previous feature, \"2 Days in the Valley\" (1997), was the same way, filled with characters who spinned into each other and bounced apart like pinballs. His movie may overachieve, may weary sometimes as it hurries between plot lines, but I prefer this kind of energy and ambition to a plodding exercise in action cliches. Herzfeld has something he wants to say.</p><p>His premise depends on Emil and Oleg being perfectly amoral idiots, shaped in their homelands by overdoses of American TV and movies. Since their countries are saturated with U.S. entertainment, and since the most popular exports are low-dialogue action shows, this is not a stretch. Is their view of America hopelessly brutal and unrealistic? Yes, but it is the view we export for study abroad.</p><p>They shoot, slash, burn and pillage their way through Manhattan, attacking former friends, call girls and bystanders. Meanwhile, Burns, as the fire inspector, finds evidence that a fire was set to conceal a murder, and De Niro engages in a little jockeying for position in the media spotlight because he wants credit for the investigation. His publicity efforts are helped by his friendship with Grammer, a star of reality TV, and his affair with a TV reporter (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/melina-kanakaredes\">Melina Kanakaredes</a>).</p><p>Emil and Oleg are really the center of the movie. They reminded me of Dick Smith and Perry Hickock from \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-in-cold-blood-1967\">In Cold Blood</a>,\" except the vicious amorality of the 1968 movie no longer seems so totally alien to the society surrounding it; programs like Grammer's \"Top Story\" are based on, feed on, depend on there being people like these.</p><p>The movie is far from unflawed. I have a private theory that half the time you see a character tied to a chair, the screenwriter ran out of ideas. Some of the getaways are unlikely. The ending is on autopilot. But there's an absolutely sensational scene where Burns tries to help a woman escape from a burning apartment; it's the best work along these lines since \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/backdraft-1991\">Backdraft</a>.\" And poignant personal moments for De Niro that keep his character from simply being a publicity hound. And performances by Roden and Taktarov that project the kind of flat, empty-headed, blank-faced evil that is so much scarier than evil by people who think about what they're doing.</p><p>Some movies, however good, seem to be simply technical exercises. Others, even if flawed, contain the seed of inspiration. John Herzfeld has not made a great movie yet, but he might. He cares, he strives, he's not content. While you're watching the movie, you question details and excesses. Afterward, you admire it for the passion of its attack, and the worthiness of its targets.</p>",

As the film opens, he's surrounded by dead bodies and spilled cocaine and is told by an officer, \"Sit on this until the uniforms get here.\" Jack rummages around in the apartment until he finds what he wants: A bottle. He pours himself a drink and sits down to wait for the uniforms. The he goes back to headquarters, where the receptionist gives him breath mints.</span><br></p><p>Jack's shift is over. The last thing he needs is another job. But his boss assigns him to transport a witness 16 blocks to a grand jury hearing. The witness has to arrive in two hours, before the grand jury's term expires. Jack goes to get the guy, who is named Eddie Bunker and is played by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/mos-def\">Mos Def</a> as a motormouth who talks all the time, and I mean <i>all</i> the time, in a litany of complaints about his treatment, his life and his fate. Eddie has the kind of voice that makes fingernails on a blackboard sound like Kenny G.</p><p>The job looks like a piece of cake. Put a guy in a car and drive 16 blocks. Jack can't make the 16 blocks. He makes a pit stop at a liquor store. Coming out, he sees the wrong kind of guy making the wrong kinds of moves on the witness in the car, and he shoots the guy, which is admirable decision-making under the circumstances. He figures out someone wants the witness dead, and so he takes him to a friendly saloon and calls his superior officer.</p><p>Not a wise decision. Frank Nugent (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/david-morse\">David Morse</a>), his chief, is the linchpin of a ring of corruption and drug dealing within the department. He is one of the people who wants to prevent Eddie Bunker from testifying. Jack knows this. He's wise to the crooked cops because he's one of them himself. But there's something about Eddie Bunker, something about his innocence, something about his naive trust in Jack, something about the way he won't shut up, that somehow gets to Jack. Just when Eddie is about to be killed in the bar, Jack shoots a cop and saves Eddie's life. Now they are both on the same side of the law.</p><p>That's the setup for \"16 Blocks,\" which is a chase picture conducted at a velocity that is just about right for a middle-age alcoholic. Unlike last week's \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/running-scared-2006\">Running Scared,</a>\" which was pitched a few degrees above manic, \"16 Blocks\" is more of a character study, a two-hander about how Jack has been fed up with the department for a long time, and Eddie's sweet, goofy nature tilts the balance. Of course, it's a good question whether Eddie is <i>really</i> the nutty motormouth he seems to be, but that's not something Jack has the time to determine right now.</p><p>The movie has been directed by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/richard-donner\">Richard Donner</a>, a specialist in combining action, chase scenes and humor (see \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/lethal-weapon-1987\">Lethal Weapon</a>,\" etc). Here he starts with three good performances: Willis, world-weary and yet with a spark of defiance; Mos Def, whose speaking role is more or less the same as the movie's running time; and David Morse, evil and bureaucratic in equal measure.</p><p>The chase scenes involve Chinatown (of course), traffic jams, and a stand-off on a bus that may owe something to the 2002 Brazilian film \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/bus-174-2003\">Bus 174</a>.\" None of this is particularly new, but all of it is done well, and Mos Def does the same thing here that <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/austin-pendleton\">Austin Pendleton</a> did in \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dirty-work-2006\">Dirty Work</a>,\" the movie I wrote about two weeks ago: He comes in from left field with a character performance that's completely unexpected in an action movie. At first I found it irritating. Then I began to wonder if something was going on beneath the surface. Eventually I was able to pick up the buried message, which was frightened, sincere and hiding behind self-satire. I did not, however, necessarily buy the story about the bakery.</p><p>One key scene gave me problems. It involves an ambulance. Actually, it involves two ambulances, which was my problem. I think maybe one additional shot or one more line of dialogue might have oriented me, but there for a moment it seemed as if certain characters had dropped into another dimension. The plot device was explained to me by Dann Gire, president of the Chicago Film Critics Association, which is yet another reason his photograph should be displayed in every post office and schoolroom.</p><p>The bedrock of the plot is the dogged determination of the Bruce Willis character. Jack may be middle-aged, he may be tired, he may be balding, he may be a drunk, but if he's played by Bruce Willis you don't want to bet against him. He gets that look in his eye that says: <i>It's going to be a pain in the ass for me to do this, but I couldn't live with myself if I didn't.</i> I always I believe that more easily than the look that merely says: <i>I will prevail because this is an action picture and I play the hero.</i></p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>Erik Soya's novel \"17,\" now a movie, is the tale of a young lad who spends the summer by the seashore and is initiated into the arts of love by his comely cousin, the upstairs maid and the downstairs maid, in that order. It is not to be confused with the novel of the same title by Booth Tarkington.</p>\r<p>The comparison between Tarkington and Soya is an interesting one, however. Both novels are set at about the same time, around 1912, and both have to do with young men stumbling across (sigh) the glories of love. If Soya's teen-agers make more startling discoveries, perhaps that is because they live in Denmark and not Indiana.</p>\r<p>Because of its delicate subject matter, \"17\" could easily have been vulgar. Perhaps we should thank its director, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/annelise-meineche\">Annelise Meineche</a>, for the fact that it is funny, healthy and ribald instead. Miss Meineche is an example of that rare species, the female director, and her woman's sense of humor gives a wry twist to otherwise routine love scenes. After her hero finally succeeds in seducing his cousin, for example, he breathes: \"Thank you.\" His cousin, disillusioned, replies: \"Same to you.\"</p>\r<p>The photography is not as beautiful as \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/elvira-madigan-1967\">Elvira Madigan</a>\" or as sensuous as \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/tom-jones\">Tom Jones</a>,\" but it's aiming at the same targets. The color, the period costumes and the spring-like outdoor locations contrive to him an air of innocence. Like Tom Jones, the hero of \"17\" is not so much a rogue, more of a victim.</p>\r<p>One of the funniest aspects of the movie probably wasn't intended. Although Jacob, the hero, is supposed to be 17, he looks more like an eternally youthful 30 -- sort of the Dennis Day of Copenhagen. His cousin, Viebke, is supposed to be about 16, but she could be served in any bar in Old Town. Still, she dresses and acts as If she were 12, squealing and giggling and kicking up her heels. The effect resembles what would happen if <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/mickey-rooney\">Mickey Rooney</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/elizabeth-taylor\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> got together on a remake of \"National Velvet.\"</p>",

He's obviously a case for treatment by a Body Swap Movie.</span><br></p><p>Revisiting the trophy case at his old high school, Mike encounters a janitor who, from the way he smiles at the camera, knows things beyond this mortal coil. If only Mike could go back to 17 and not make all the same mistakes. In \"17 Again,\" he can. He falls into a Twilight Zone vortex and emerges as Zac Efron. They say be careful what you wish for, because you might get it. Mike should have been more specific. Instead of wishing to be 17 again, he should have wished to go back 20 years in time.</p><p>Yes, he becomes himself trapped inside his own 17-year-old body. Same wife, same kids, same problems. As Old Mike getting divorced, he'd moved in with his best friend, Ned (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/thomas-lennon\">Thomas Lennon</a>), and now he throws himself on Ned's mercy: Will Ned pose as his father, so Young Mike can be his son and help out his kids by enrolling in the same high school again? Ned, who is a software millionaire and middle-age fanboy, agrees, especially after he falls helplessly in love with the high school principal, Jane (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/melora-hardin\">Melora Hardin</a>).</p><p>Young Mike becomes the new best friend of his insecure son, Alex (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/sterling-knight\">Sterling Knight</a>). Then he meets Alex's mom, Scarlet (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/leslie-mann\">Leslie Mann</a>), who, of course, before the vortex was his wife, and before that his high school bride (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/allison-miller\">Allison Miller</a>). She thinks it's strange that he looks <i>exactly</i> like the boy she married at 17. He explains he is the son of an uncle, who I guess would have to be Old Mike's brother, so it's curious Old Scarlet never met him, but if she doesn't ask that, why should I?</p><p>In high school, Young Mike again becomes a basketball star, befriends Alex, and attempts to defend his Gothish daughter, Maggie (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/michelle-trachtenberg\">Michelle Trachtenberg</a>), against the predations of her jerk boyfriend, who as a hot-rodding jock traveling with a posse is, of course, the <i>last</i> guy in school who would date, or be dated by, a moody girl who wears black.</p><p>I've seen Body Switches before (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/tom-hanks\">Tom Hanks</a> in \"Big\"). The first act of this movie seemed all retread. Then it started to dig in. There are twin romances; as Shakespeare demonstrated, one must be serious and the other farcical. Young Mike is still seriously in love with his wife, Old Scarlet, and she is powerfully attracted to this boy who's a double for her first love. She thinks that's wrong. He knows it isn't but how can he explain?</p><p>Meanwhile, best buddy Ned courts Principal Masterson, who for the first time in his life has Taught Him What Love Means. Before her, ecstasy was owning Darth Vader's costume. I will not describe what happens the first time they go out to dinner, except to say that it's comic genius, perfectly played by Melora Hardin and Thomas Lennon.</p><p>I attended a screening held by a radio station, which attracted mainly teenage girls who left their boyfriends behind. When Zac Efron took off his T-shirt, the four in front of me squealed as if there were buzzers in their seats. Now that he's a little older, Efron has a Tom Cruiseish charm, and a lot of confidence. Why Matthew Perry was cast as his adult self is hard to figure; does your head change its shape in 20 years?</p><p>\"17 Again\" is pleasant, harmless PG-13 entertainment, with a plot a little more surprising and acting a little better than I expected. Mike is dispatched into that vortex by the bearded old janitor with a delighted smile. The janitor (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/brian-doyle-murray\">Brian Doyle-Murray</a>) is quite a convenience, supplying vortexes when needed. If his smile reminds you of anyone, he's played by Bill Murray's brother.</p>",

So the series gave us lot of motivation.</p>\r<p>The same series seems to have inspired \"1776.\" Its singular historical insight is that all of those famous Americans never grew up. They just put on wigs and grew sideburns and continued to act in the same childish ways.</p>\r<p>This is an insult to the real men who were Adams, Jefferson, Franklin and the rest -- but then we've emasculated our founding fathers in story and song for so long that they're practically a set of caricatures. By the time \"1776\" came along, the stage was set for a dumb, simplistic romp through Independence Hall. I guess we don't want to fully recognize the stature of those early leaders; might make the present variety look a little transparent.</p>\r<p>The movie, as everybody must know by now, involves the days immediately before the signing of the Declaration on July 4. The performances trapped inside these roles, as you might expect, are fairly dreadful. There are good actors in the movie (especially <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/william-daniels\">William Daniels</a> as Adams and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/donald-madden\">Donald Madden</a> as James Dickinson), but they're forced to strut and posture so much that you wonder if they ever scratched or spit or anything.</p>\r<p>Apart from that, there are structural problems. The stage version made much of a correspondence between John and Abigail Adams, in which she urged him onward and upward. In the movie, this is handled by a series of materializations in which Abigail, looking for all the world like the vampire countess of \"Taste the Blood of Dracula,\" appears surrounded by soft focus and gives John the morning line.</p>\r<p>I can hardly bear to remember the songs, much less discuss them. Perhaps I shouldn't. It is just too damn bad this movie didn't take advantage of its right to the pursuit of happiness.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>Here we have it, the third entry in this seasons body-exchange sweepstakes. 18 Again! begins with the same premise as <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/like-father-like-son-1987\">Like Father Like Son</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/vice-versa-1988\">Vice Versa</a>, and despite the considerable presence of <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/george-burns\">George Burns</a>, it finishes in a tie for last. Its an annual cliche at Oscar time that the competition would mean more if the actors had all played the same roles. In the case of these three movies, the race isnt close: Vice Versa wins, and the other two trip over the starting line.</p>\r<p>But why, you may ask, am I using so many metaphors from the world of footraces? Thats because 18 Again! cross-fertilizes two durable genres. Not only do we have an old man and his grandson trading minds and bodies, but we also have one of the most durable endings in the movies, the Big Race.</p>\r<p>18 Again! even includes a cliche so old I thought it had been retired: the moment when the hero stumbles, falls, picks himself up and keeps right on running. Does he win the race? Are there stars in the sky? Vice Versa and Like Father Like Son were about a father and son trading places. In recognition of Burnss age, 18 Again! has him trading places with a grandson. <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/tony-roberts\">Tony Roberts</a> plays the generation in between. The story: Burns is the legendary founder of the family firm, which Roberts now runs. Father and son dont communicate well, maybe because Burns never takes his sons ideas seriously. But he does have a great love for his grandson.</p>\r<p>At Burnss 81st birthday party, he closes his eyes and makes a wish. Hed like to be 18 again, with all the power and energy he remembers. He opens his eyes and his wish somehow has been granted: He inhabits his grandsons body, and the grandson (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/charlie-schlatter\">Charlie Schlatter</a>) inhabits his.</p>\r<p>The kid is on the high school track team, where hes kind of a nerd; he doesnt have his grandfathers never-say-die spirit. But with Burns inside the teenage body, the kid turns into a champion, and that leads up to the big race and all of its preordained suspense.</p>\r<p>The movie also contains other developments that are less than surprises. There is, for example, the fact that the body switch also means a girlfriend switch. <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/anita-morris\">Anita Morris</a> plays Burnss mistress, who cant understand whats gotten into him, so to speak. And <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jennifer-runyon\">Jennifer Runyon</a> is the girl that the grandson loves from afar; she appreciates the most direct approach that Burns employs, once hes given the proper body to work with. There is hardly a line of dialogue involving either of these characters that is witty, or original, or comes as a surprise.</p>\r<p>The whole project seems to have been enveloped in a miasma of good intentions and heartwarming sentiments. Theres no edge, no bite and none of the inspired body language that made Vice Versa so special.</p>\r<p>The movie makes no attempt to really imagine what it would be like to inhabit another body; it just springs the gimmick on us and starts unreeling its sitcom plot.</p>\r<p>Although Burns is, of course, a beloved institution, and any opportunity to see him is welcome, he is not given much to do in the movie, and he doesnt do much with it. His character essentially is recycled from his old material and his patented talk-show gags, We hear him sing his 1980 hit, I Wish I Were 18 Again!, of course, and that is fun, but we also have to hear him recite that tired old line about how he would date women his age, if there were women his age. No real effort has been made to find any differences between Burns and the character he plays in this movie.</p>\r<p>Burns began the current stage of his long career in 1977, when he was recruited for the lead in Oh, God! Convinced he never could play the part, he asked the producers what God was like, and was told: Hes a lot like George Burns. The problem is, Burns, God love him, has been getting that answer too often.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>The movie \"187'' tells the story of a high school teacher who is driven mad by the system. We can well believe it, especially given the schools portrayed in the film, where violent bullies control the classrooms, and the spineless administrators--terrified of lawsuits--refuse to back up the teachers. But the movie ends in a way that will disturb its more thoughtful viewers.</p>\r<p><a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/samuel-l-jackson\">Samuel L. Jackson</a> stars as Trevor, a dedicated and gifted teacher who does a demonstration of centrifugal force that I, for one, wanted to try for myself. He finds the pages of his textbook defaced with a scrawled \"187,'' which is the police code for \"homicide.'' It's a warning, he thinks, from a dangerous student. He gets no sympathy or support from his principal, who says, \"You know what your problem is? On the one hand, you think someone is going to kill you, and on the other hand, you actually think kids are paying attention in your class.'' The warning is real, Trevor is attacked and seriously wounded, and then the main story begins 15 months later, after the teacher has switched coasts and is trying to make a fresh start as a substitute science teacher in the San Fernando Valley. Trevor is no longer quite the man he was. He confides in Ellen (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/kelly-rowan\">Kelly Rowan</a>), a friendly fellow teacher, that the assault meant \"the robbery of my passion, my spark, my unguarded self. I miss them.'' The California school is no better than the one he left in New York. Thugs and gang-bangers challenge the teachers for control of the classroom and threaten lawsuits if teachers try to discipline them. The administration gives no support. It's as if the whole system is engaged in a charade. The students pretend to study, the teachers pretend to teach, and nobody rocks the boat.</p>\r<p>But Trevor is different. He really wants to teach. He draws closer to Ellen, but she senses a wall that will always be there, and he quotes Thomas Wolfe's despairing cry that loneliness is the human condition. He does what he can. He offers to tutor a student named Rita, but she misinterprets his attention and offers him sex. He visits the home of a violent student named Benny and wishes he hadn't. He is counseled by a disillusioned teacher named Childress (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/john-heard\">John Heard</a>), who finds out he's the famous teacher who was attacked out East and says, \"I'm giving advice to a guy with a Purple Heart.'' And then all of the plot threads come together in a way I will not reveal, but which raised serious questions in my mind about motivation, about plausibility and even about whether a climactic final scene should have been in the movie at all. The movie, written by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/scott-yagemann\">Scott Yagemann</a> and directed by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/kevin-reynolds\">Kevin Reynolds</a> (\"Waterworld\"), has elements that are thoughtful and tough about inner-city schools, and other elements that belong in a crime thriller or a war movie.</p>\r<p>At the end, I know, Trevor has come unhinged. I accept that and believe it. But it feels like the movie lost the nerve of its original story impulse and sought safety in elements borrowed from thrillers. Its destination doesn't have much to do with how it got there.</p>\r<p>Too bad, because \"187'' features a strong and sympathetic performance by Jackson, who has so many different notes in his work; here he is able to make the teacher come completely alive--right until the end, when the plot manipulations bury him. I also liked the tentative sweetness of Rowan as the friendly teacher, although the relationship isn't resolved very neatly. The young actors playing the dangerous students are focused and effective; they include Lobo Sebastian as Benny and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/clifton-gonzalez-gonzalez\">Clifton Gonzalez Gonzalez</a> as Cesar.</p>\r<p>But . . . I dunno. If you see the movie, ask yourself if the last third is really satisfying. Was there another way to present the same kind of frustration and despair? Are they really proving anything in the final confrontation? What do they think they're proving? The motivation seems cloudy on both sides.</p>\r",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>What high hopes were inspired by Bernardo Bertolucci's \"1900\" -- and how few of them are realized. This was to be the great epic statement by the young Italian director generally considered to be the greatest since Fellini; the director who made \"The Conformist\" before he was 30, and whose \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-last-tango-in-paris-1972\">Last Tango in Paris</a>\" was hailed by Pauline Kael as the most important artistic event since Stravinsky's \"Rite of Spring.\" Bertolucci had his pick of actors a free run with his budget, the freedom to make a personal film. And he blew it.</p>\r<p>I remember the excitement before the world premiere of \"1900\" at the Cannes Film Festival in May, 1976. Tickets and passes were being traded on an impromptu black market, and the crush at the first morning screening was so savage that one man was pushed through a plate-glass door. The atmosphere was totally different by the end of the afternoon, after the dual press screenings for both halves of the (then) 320-minute film. People were quiet and puzzled and dismayed: How had Bertolucci gone so wrong?</p>\r<p>The case for \"1900\" has become something of a cause in the 18 months since that disastrous premiere. The film's producer, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/alberto-grimaldi\">Alberto Grimaldi</a>, had worked with Fellini, Visconti and Pontecorvo and knew a thing or two about movies that ran over budget and length. He'd gambled with Bertolucci, and now he had this enormously expensive and virtually unmarketable film on his hands. He prepared one shorter version, Bertolucci stood by the original version, and until Bertolucci finally made his own shorter (247 minute) cut, it almost seemed as if \"1900\" would never be seen at all.</p>\r<p>I hate to say it, but maybe that would have been a blessing: The movie could have gone into film history as a great lost classic, and Grimaldi could have been branded the villian, and Bertolucci could have gone on to his next film (as, indeed, he has). Because \"1900\" is a film out of control. A film conceived on such an epic scale that it just doesn't fit. A film in which Bertolucci struggles for hours to make his statement about the class struggle in Italy only to end on a note of throwaway goofiness.</p>\r<p>The movie begins on the day of Verdi's death (for no particular reason, I'm afraid). It records the births of boys in two families -- one to a rich landowning family, the other to peasants living on their land. The boys grow up together as playmates, and there's a Huckleberry Finn sort of charm to the scenes in which they trap frogs and dare each other to lay down on the tracks while a train thunders overhead. But the movie has decades to cover and can't linger to get us deeply involved.</p>\r<p>The boys grow up (the rich one into <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/robert-de-niro\">Robert De Niro</a>, the poor one into <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/gerard-depardieu\">Gerard Depardieu</a>). Their fathers (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/burt-lancaster\">Burt Lancaster</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/sterling-hayden\">Sterling Hayden</a>, respectively) die, and so the young men become heirs to the ancient customs and feuds of the region. Mussolini is on the rise, and the town's leading fascist blackshirt (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/donald-sutherland\">Donald Sutherland</a>) works for De Niro and persecutes the local Communists (including Depardieu).</p>\r<p>And then ... well, a synopsis might resemble Genesis, filled with marriages and births, deaths and murders, rivalries and betrayals and thefts and passions. De Niro marries a beautiful young woman (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/dominique-sanda\">Dominique Sanda</a>), and Sutherland murders a child on the wedding day and tries to pin the blame on Depardieu. And Bertolucci's camera, always moving, swooping, gliding effortlessly from one stunning composition to another, hardly seems to stop to see these events: It's as if the movie has a beauty apart from its content, and Bertolucci dazzles us visually as an apology for the narrative mess he's in.</p>\r<p>There are scenes you will remember (and, yes, \"1900,\" for all its problems, is a movie that film buffs should see). There's the scene at the wedding when a white horse -- a wedding gift -- is brought into the room. And the moment, also at the wedding, when Sanda takes off her white veil and places it on the head of a bitterly jealous guest. A confrontation between the two men that ends with Depardieu throwing a sausage after the departing De Niro. Scenes in the snow, and marvelously-painted harvest scenes. And the sudden violence of Sutherland, killing a cat, and Depardieu, killing a pig, and the townspeople, killing Sutherland.</p>\r<p>But the movie doesn't seem to go anywhere. It's an epic only by virtue of its length. Think of the command <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/francis-coppola\">Francis Coppola</a> had over his saga of an Italian-American family in the two \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-godfather-1972\">The Godfather</a>\"films (which together approximate the length of \"1900\"), and you'll see how the right director can take masses of material and generations of characters and achieve an operatic sweep. Then look at \"1900,\" and reflect that Bertolucci is at his best in scenes with two people in a room (Brando and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/maria-schneider\">Maria Schneider</a> in \"Last Tango,\" <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/alida-valli\">Alida Valli</a> and Giulio Brogi in \"The Spider's Strategem\").</p>\r<p>Bertolucci can direct great set pieces, of course, and some of his biggest scenes (like the outdoor dances that are his favorites) are spectacular. But he needs well-defined characters to anchor his stories, and he seems more confident when he drills into their psyches instead of spreading himself all over the ideological map. </p>\r<p>\"1900\" ventures to make sweeping statements about Italian politics over more than half a century, and then ends with its two central characters, now old men, scuffing in the road. They look like a couple of coots, and the scene trivalizes even further what's gone before, but then perhaps a throwaway ending is only appropriate for this film.</p>",

It's an attempt at that most tricky of genres, the blockbuster comedy, and it tries so </span><i style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\">hard</i><span style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"> to dazzle us that we want a break. It's a good-hearted, cheerfully disorganized mess that makes us appreciate \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-dr-strangelove-1964\">Dr. Strangelove</a>,\" just a little bit more.</span><br></p>\r<p>It takes place in the opening days of World War II, as rumors of a Japanese invasion sweep the west coast and a real Japanese submarine finds itself somewhere off Long Beach. California's in the grip of war fever, every red-blooded young man wants to be in uniform, the dance halls are jammed to the music of Glenn Miller, and up on Hollywood Boulevard the zoot-suiters are rioting.</p>\r<p>Spielberg apparently originally conceived some of this material as a series of set pieces, and there's a sequence in the dance hall that works wonderfully: While lookalikes for the Andrews Sisters go berserk at the microphone, servicemen and their girls get into a dance contest that degenerates into a cross between a brawl and the big dance number in \"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.\"</p>\r<p>Because Spielberg allows this sequence to continue until it finds its own rhythm, it has a nice zany feel to it. But most of the other stuff in \"1941\" feels forced together chaotically, as if the editors wanted to keep the material moving at any cost. The movie finally reduces itself to an assault on our eyes and ears, a nonstop series of climaxes, screams, explosions, double-takes, sight gags, and ethnic jokes that's finally just not very funny.</p>\r<p>The closest thing the movie has to a central character is <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/john-belushi\">John Belushi</a>, as a P-40 fighter pilot who flies up and down the coast looking for Japanese and finally crash-lands in the middle of Hollywood Boulevard. The boulevard has earlier been the scene of several other buzzings by military aircraft, in scenes involving lots of special effects thatt must have been difficult to create but come out so disorganized that we're more confused than amused. With the exception of a few high points like a runaway ferris wheel, the special effects in \"1941\" seem disorganized in general: If we don't have a clear idea of what the big moments mean to the plot, how can we know if they're funny?</p>\r<p> That leads to the real problem with \"1941\", I think: This movie was never thought through on a basic level of character and story. All sorts of things are happening, but we're never clear why they have to happen and we haven't been told enough about the characters to care if they survive or not.</p>\r<p> Everybody races around like people caught in a Jack Davis drawing for \"Mad\" magazine. Comic talent is wasted. Belushi hardly has 25 words of dialogue in the whole movie, and is called upon only to look manic, run around frantically, and play the slob in the cockpit. At one point, scurrying bandy-legged here and there, he's even repeating a piece of business from \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/national-lampoons-animal-house-1978\">National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House</a>.\" Why not? Nobody's given him a new character to play.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p><a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/george-orwell\">George Orwell</a> made no secret of the fact that his novel 1984 was not really about the future but about the very time he wrote it in, the bleak years after World War II when England shivered in poverty and hunger. In a novel where passion is depicted as a crime, the greatest passion is expressed, not for sex, but for contraband strawberry jam, coffee, and chocolate. What Orwell feared, when he wrote his novel in 1948, was that Hitlerism, Stalinism, centralism, and conformity would catch hold and turn the world into a totalitarian prison camp. It is hard, looking around the globe, to say that he was altogether wrong.</p><p>Michael Radford's brilliant film of Orwell's vision does a good job of finding that line between the \"future\" world of 1984 and the grim postwar world in which Orwell wrote. The movie's 1984 is like a year arrived at through a time warp, an alternative reality that looks constructed out of old radio tubes and smashed office furniture. There is not a single prop in this movie that you couldn't buy in a junkyard, and yet the visual result is uncanny: Orwell's hero, Winston Smith, lives in a world of grim and crushing inhumanity, of bombed factories, bug-infested bedrooms, and citizens desperate for the most simple pleasures.</p><p>The film opens with Smith rewriting history: His task is to change obsolete government documents so that they reflect current reality. He methodically scratches out old headlines, obliterates the photographs of newly made \"unpersons,\" and attends mass rallies at which the worship of Big Brother alternates with numbing reports of the endless world war that is still going on somewhere, involving somebody. Into Smith's world comes a girl, Julia, who slips him a note of stunning force. The note says, \"I love you.\" Smith and Julia become revolutionaries by making love, walking in the countryside, and eating strawberry jam. Then Smith is summoned to the office of O'Brien, a high official of the \"inner party,\" who seems to be a revolutionary too, and gives him the banned writings of an enemy of the state.</p><p>This story is, of course, well known. 1984 must be one of the most widely read novels of our time. What is remarkable about the movie is how completely it satisfied my feelings about the book; the movie looks, feels, and almost tastes and smells like Orwell's bleak and angry vision. <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/john-hurt\">John Hurt</a>, with his scrawny body and lined and weary face, makes the perfect Winston Smith; and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/richard-burton\">Richard Burton</a>, looking so old and weary in this film that it is little wonder he died soon after finishing it, is the immensely cynical O'Brien, who feels close to people only while he is torturing them. <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/suzanna-hamilton\">Suzanna Hamilton</a> is Julia, a fierce little war orphan whose rebellion is basically inspired by her hungers.</p><p>Radford's style in the movie is an interesting experiment. Like Chaplin in \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/modern-times-1972\">Modern Times</a>,\" he uses passages of dialogue that are not meant to be understood -- nonsense words and phrases, garbled as they are transmitted over Big Brother's primitive TV, and yet listened to no more or less urgently than the messages that say something. The 1954 film version of Orwell's novel turned it into a cautionary, simplistic science-fiction tale. This version penetrates much more deeply into the novel's heart of darkness.</p>",

The woman is rendered unconscious, the man is killed, and .\r. . but I'm getting into the plot.</p><p>There\rare two cops: Wes (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/eric-stoltz\">Eric Stoltz</a>) and Alvin (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jeff-daniels\">Jeff Daniels</a>). Wes has always\rdreamed of being a homicide detective, but finds himself on the vice squad,\rwhere he lacks the heart to entrap a sweet, harmless girl (Kathleen Luong) who\rworks in a massage parlor. The cops stumble onto the murder scene without\rintending to and are thrilled to be working on a real crime.</p><p>Meanwhile,\rwe meet Hopper (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/greg-cruttwell\">Greg Cruttwell</a>), an obnoxious British art dealer, who has a\rkidney stone attack and is rescued by a man in a stolen car. Hopper's secretary\r(<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/glenne-headly\">Glenne Headly</a>) nurses him, although he constantly insults her with offers of\rbreast implants and liposuction. Then Dosmo enters their lives by rolling down\ra hill after escaping from an exploding car, and holds them hostage while\rcooking them pasta.</p><p>And\rthen there's Teddy Peppers, played by the director <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/paul-mazursky\">Paul Mazursky</a>. Teddy is a\rsuicidal screenwriter-director whose career has gone into the toilet. He plans\rhis suicide but doesn't want to leave his little dog homeless. In one of the\rmovie's best scenes, he encounters an actor (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/austin-pendleton\">Austin Pendleton</a>) who smilingly\rinsults him without mercy, pointing out every milestone on his descent to the\rbottom of the industry. Meanwhile, a real homicide detective (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/keith-carradine\">Keith Carradine</a>)\ris assigned to the murder, and his path crosses those of the vice cops and the\rSpader character, who is impersonating a cop.</p><p>All\rof these characters inhabit the San Fernando Valley, which is to Beverly Hills\ras hell is to Dante's Inferno. We sense that they're people who see success\revery day, who taste it and smell it and rub shoulders with it, but never have\rbeen able to grasp it. Like the Olympic skier, they've never placed higher than\rfourth. Yet they obsess about image; the art dealer, who has no sexual interest\rin his secretary, wants to pay for her plastic surgery because it will make\r*him* look better.</p><p>The\rplot underlies even the most inexplicable scenes and eventually links even the\rmost widely separated characters, but what makes the movie fun is the dialogue\rand the behavior. I especially liked the Mazursky character, who dumps his Emmy\rin a trash can, and the Aiello character, who consoles the art dealer's\rsecretary: It's just part of his nature to be cruel--don't take offense. The\rmovie illustrates a world view shared by a lot of people in Los Angeles: If\rthere are only six degrees of separation between any two people in the world,\rthere are only two or maybe three separating everyone in the Valley from the\rrich and famous who light up the pages of the National Enquirer. A cop can become\r<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/joseph-wambaugh\">Joseph Wambaugh</a>. A personal trainer can become <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/steven-seagal\">Steven Seagal</a>. A hooker can\rbecome Heidi Fleiss.</p><p>On\rthe surface, there are great distances between those who have made it and those\rwho are still on hold. But then you find they actually know one another in the\rmost unexpected ways, often having to do with sex and ambition. It's fun to\rwatch 2 Days in the Valley in the moment, and then fun afterward to think\rabout the way the story was put together, and all of those lives connected.</p><p></p>",

Here's a wonderful actress who has worked with Kieslowski, Jarmusch, Tavernier, Godard and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/agnieszka-holland\">Agnieszka Holland</a>, and you'd think her only influence was <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/woody-allen\">Woody Allen</a>.</p>\r<p>In an admirable way of briefing us on her character Marion's story so far, she opens with a puppet show being performed for her small son. This is the child she produced with the <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/adam-goldberg\">Adam Goldberg</a> character in \"2 Days in Paris,\" and since that film was about the disintegration of their relationship, it's no surprise he's history. She's back home in New York, living with a radio talker named Mingus (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/chris-rock\">Chris Rock</a>), who has a small daughter. They have a happy household, until her family arrives from France to meet Mingus.</p>\r<p>We met her father Jeannot (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/albert-delpy\">Albert Delpy</a>, her real father) in the earlier film. He is a friendly and well-meaning old man with a genius for being a fish out of water even when he's in water. Even worse is her sister Rose (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/alexia-landeau\">Alexia Landeau</a>), jealous and snippy, and Rose's boyfriend, Manu (Alex Nahon), who bodes trouble because he was Marion's former boyfriend. As we recall from \"2 Days in Paris,\" Marion has had a lot of former boyfriends; the Adam Goldberg character grew alarmed at how often she seemed to run into them in her old hometown.</p>\r<p>Rose's rivalry expresses itself in many ways, from bitchy sniping at a family dinner, to an unsettling custom of walking around the apartment mostly undressed. Is she trying to seduce Mingus, make Manu jealous or simply exposing herself for a horny neighbor (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/dylan-baker\">Dylan Baker</a>)? She gets nowhere with Mingus, played by Chris Rock as the most stable and sane member of the cast. His refuge is to retreat into his man cave and have thoughtful conversations with a life-sized cardboard cutout of Barack Obama.</p>\r<p>Marion, I should have mentioned, is an artist, and one of the excuses for the family visit is a big exhibit of her work. Most of it is physical, but the centerpiece is bold and conceptual: She has auctioned off her soul. One of the film's strangest scenes is her conversation with the man who buys it, portrayed by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/vincent-gallo\">Vincent Gallo</a>, playing the role as Mephistopheles to Delpy's Faust. (Now there's a sentence that may never have been written before.) Gallo has undeniable screen presence, but here I believe Delpy didn't think through how best to use it. As a film-writing exercise, I suggest a series of scenes between Gallo and various characters whose souls he has purchased.</p>\r<p>Julie Delpy has particularly impressed me over the years. She began with intelligence, beauty and charm, she rose to the challenges of some of the leading filmmakers of her time, she and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/ethan-hawke\">Ethan Hawke</a> co-starred in Richard Linklater's immortal \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/before-sunrise-1995\">Before Sunrise</a>\" (1995) and \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/before-sunset-2004\">Before Sunset</a>\" (2004), and she enrolled in the celebrated film school of New York University. Oh, and she is a singer-songwriter. Seeing her father Albert here may explain some of that. He and her mother, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/marie-pillet\">Marie Pillet</a>, were leading avant-garde actors and directors on the French stage.</p>\r<p>All very well, but what impresses me more is that she has a lighthearted way about her and takes chances in comedies like this. It is hard enough to be good at all, but to be good in comedy speaks for your character.</p>\r",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\">I once gave flowers to a French girl and was told they were \"flagrant.\" When Marion, the character played by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/julie-delpy\">Julie Delpy</a> in \"2 Days in Paris\" makes mistakes like that, she knows what she's doing. If her relationship with her lover Jack is coming apart at the seams, that's her with a little thimble and needle, pulling out the stitches. The movie covers the end of a European vacation which was intended to mend their relationship, and the holiday has gone badly. Sometimes when you want to know, really know, somebody, you find out that actually you'd rather not.</span><br></p><p>Jack (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/adam-goldberg\">Adam Goldberg</a>) had a bad time in Venice. How can that be? Was it <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/woody-allen\">Woody Allen</a> who said the worst sex he ever had wasn't that bad? Same with bad trips to Venice. Jack got severe diarrhea, and tried Marion's patience by taking photos of everything, apparently, except the diarrhea itself. Has he never heard of Imodium, that word along with \"taxi\" and \"OK\" that gets most Americans around the world? And did he think he was needed to remedy the world's tragic shortage of photos of Venice?</p><p>But never mind. The last two days of the holiday are to be spent in Paris, Marion's hometown, before they return to New York, where they now live. They move in upstairs from Marion's parents, Anna and Jeannot (played by Delpy's real parents, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/marie-pillet\">Marie Pillet</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/albert-delpy\">Albert Delpy</a>). Culture shock sets in at the first meal, braised rabbit. You'd think Anna and Jeannot could try the merciful American tactic of calling it \"chicken\" but perhaps when you serve the rabbit head along with its eyeballs, it looks like a chicken that has been fed too many hormones.</p><p>Marion and Jack wander about Paris, talking in that way that lovers have when they're beginning to get on each other's nerves. But, no, this is not a retread of Richard Linklater's \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/before-sunset-2004\">Before Sunset</a>\" (2004), in which Delpy and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/ethan-hawke\">Ethan Hawke</a> walked and talked around Paris. It is a contemplation of incompatibility, as Paris brings out a side of Marion that Jack has never quite seen: Is she a radical political activist and a shameless slut, or does she only act like one? She runs into old boyfriends so often it makes Paris seem like a small town, and attacks one of them, in a restaurant, for taking a sex vacation to Thailand.</p><p>At home, her father quizzes Jack on French culture, and her mother is so eager to wash and press his clothes that he barely has time to get out of them. Both of Delpy's parents are professional actors, and so these are only performances, I hope. In addition to casting her parents, Delpy puts her mark on this film in many other ways: She starred, directed, wrote, edited, co-produced, composed the score and sang a song. When a women takes that many jobs, we slap her down for vanity. When a man does, we call him the new <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/orson-welles\">Orson Welles</a>.</p><p>Delpy in fact has made a smart film with an edge to it; her Jack and Marion reveal things about themselves they never thought they'd tell anybody, and we wonder why they ever went out on a second date. Much has been made of the similarities between Delpy here and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/diane-keaton\">Diane Keaton</a> in \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-annie-hall-1977\">Annie Hall</a>\" but if Delpy's character found a spider as big as a Buick in the bathroom, she'd braise it and serve it up for lunch.</p><p>Which is an oblique way of saying that Julie Delpy is an original, a woman who refuses to be defined or limited. Her first great roles were in Bertrand Tavernier's \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/beatrice-1988\">Beatrice</a>\" (1987), Agnieszka Holland's \"Europa Europa\" (1990) and Krzysztof Kieslowski's \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/white-1994\">White</a>\" (1994); she was in Linklater's \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/before-sunrise-1995\">Before Sunrise</a>\" \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/waking-life-2001-1\">Waking Life</a>\" and \"Before Sunset\" and she dumped <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/bill-murray\">Bill Murray</a> at the beginning of Jim Jarmusch's \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/broken-flowers-2005\">Broken Flowers</a>.\" In between, she studied film at NYU and made herself available for 30 student productions.</p><p>What she has done here is avoid all temptation to recycle the usual lovers-in-Paris possibilities, and has created two original, quirky characters so obsessed with their differences that Paris is almost a distraction. I don't think I heard a single accordion in the whole film.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>John Singleton's \"2 Fast 2 Furious\" tells a story so shamelessly preposterous all we can do is shake our heads in disbelief. Consider that the big climax involves a Miami druglord who hires two street racers to pick up bags full of money in North Beach and deliver them in the Keys, and adds, \"You make it, I'll personally hand you $100 Gs at the finish line.\" Hell, for 10 Gs, I'd rent a van at the Aventura Mall and deliver the goods myself.</p><p>But this is not an ordinary delivery. The drivers are expected to drive at speeds ranging from 100 mph to jet-assisted takeoff velocities, which of course might attract the attention of the police, so the druglord has to arrange a 15-minute \"window\" with a corrupt cop, who he persuades by encouraging a rat to eat its way into his intestines. Does it strike you that this man is going to a lot of extra trouble? Despite the persuasive rat, the cops do chase the speed-racers, but they have anticipated this, and drive their cars into a vast garage, after which dozens or hundreds of other supercharged vehicles emerge from the garage, confusing the cops with a high-speed traffic jam. Oh, and some guys in monster trucks crush a lot of squad cars first. It is my instinct that the owners of monster trucks and street machines treat them with tender loving care, and don't casually volunteer to help out a couple of guys (one they've never seen before) by crashing their vehicles into police cars. You can get arrested for that.</p><p>Does it sound like I'm complaining? I'm not complaining. I'm grinning. \"2 Fast 2 Furious\" is a video game crossed with a buddy movie, a bad cop-good cop movie, a Miami druglord movie, a chase movie and a comedy. It doesn't have a brain in its head, but it's made with skill and style and, boy, is it fast and furious.</p><p>How much like a video game is it? The two drivers are named Brian <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/oconnor\">O&#x27;Connor</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/paul-walker\">Paul Walker</a>) and Roman Pearce (Tyrese). As they race down city streets at one-fifth the speed of sound, they talk to each other. They can't hear each other, but that doesn't matter, because what they say is exactly the kind of stuff that avatars say in video games. I took some notes: \"Let's see what this thing can do!\" \"Watch this, bro!\" \"Let's see if you still got it, Brian!\" \"How you like them apples!?\" Walker returns from the original \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-fast-and-the-furious-2001\">The Fast and the Furious</a>\" (2001), which established <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/vin-diesel\">Vin Diesel</a> as a star. Rather than appear in this movie, about cops infiltrating his car gang to bust the drug cartel, Diesel decided instead to make \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-man-apart-2003\">A Man Apart</a>,\" playing a cop fighting the drug cartel. Oddly enough, F&amp;F2 is the better movie.</p><p>Walker's co-star is Tyrese, aka <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/tyrese-gibson\">Tyrese Gibson</a>, who was so good in Singleton's \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/baby-boy-2001\">Baby Boy</a>\" (2001) and is the engine that drives \"2 Fast 2 Furious\" with energy and charisma. He's like an angrier Vin Diesel. Walker, who gets top billing in both movies, is pleasant but not compelling, sort of a <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/don-johnson\">Don Johnson</a> lite.</p><p>Other key roles are by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/cole-hauser\">Cole Hauser</a> as Carter Verone, the druglord, whose Colombian parents didn't name him after Jimmy, since he's too old for that, but possibly after Mother Maybelle; and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/eva-mendes\">Eva Mendes</a>, as Monica Fuentes, the sexy undercover cop who has been on Verone's payroll for nine months and is either sleeping with him or is a sensational conversationalist.</p><p>O'Connor and Pearce are teamed up to work undercover as drivers for Verone, and promised that their records will be cleaned up if the mission succeeds. First they have to win their jobs. Verone assembles several teams of drivers and tells them he left a package in his red Ferrari at an auto pound 20 miles away. First team back with the package \"gets the opportunity to work with me.\" That sets off a high-speed race down Route 95 during which one car is crushed under the wheels of a truck, several more crash, and various racers and, presumably, civilians are killed. O'Connor and Pearce return with the package. As they're driving back, they don't even seem to pass the scene of the incredible carnage they caused in the opposite lanes; just as well, because at 120 mph you don't want to hit a gapers' block.</p><p>All of the chases involve the apparently inexhaustible supply of squad cars in South Florida. There's also a traffic jam in the sky, involving police and news helicopters. At one point a copter broadcaster hears a loud noise, looks up, and says \"what was that?\" but we never find out what it was, perhaps because the movie is just too fast and too furious to slow down for a helicopter crash.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>\"Twenty Dates'' tells the story of <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/myles-berkowitz\">Myles Berkowitz</a>, a man who wants to make a film, and to fall in love. These areas are his \"two greatest failures, professional and personal,'' so he decides to make a film about going out on 20 dates. By the film's end, he has won the love of the lovely Elisabeth--maybe--but his professional life is obviously still a failure.</p><p>The film has the obnoxious tone of a boring home movie narrated by a guy shouting in your ear. We learn how he gets a $60,000 investment from a man named Elie Samaha and uses it to hire a cameraman and a sound man to follow him around on his dates. Elie is never seen on film, but is taped with an (allegedly) hidden recorder while he threatens Berkowitz, complains about the quality of the footage, and insists on sex, stars--and a scene with <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/tia-carrere\">Tia Carrere</a>.</p><p>Elie has a point. Even though $60,000 is a low budget, you can't exactly see the money up there on the screen. I've seen features shot for half as much that were more impressive. What's worse is that Berkowitz loses our trust early in the film and never regains it. I don't know how much of this film is real, if any of it is. Some scenes are admittedly staged and others feel that way.</p><p>Even though Berkowitz presumably displays himself in his best light, I couldn't find a moment when he said anything of charm or interest to one of his dates. He's surprised when one woman is offended to learn she's being photographed with a hidden camera, and when another one delivers an (unseen) hand wound that requires 20 stitches. The movie's best dialogue is: \"I could have sworn that Karen and I had fallen in love. And now, it's never to be, because I couldn't ever get close to her--at least not closer than 90 feet, which was specified in the restraining order.'' One of his dates, Stephanie, is a Hollywood wardrobe mistress. He asks her for free costumes for his movie (if it's a doc, why does it need costumes?). She leaves for the restroom, \"and I never saw her again.'' Distraught, he consults Robert <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/mckay\">McKay</a>, a writing teacher, and McKay gives him theories about screen romance, which are irrelevant, of course, to an allegedly true-life documentary.</p><p>And what about Elie? He sounds unpleasant, vulgar and tasteless (although no more so than many Hollywood producers). But why are we shown the outside of the county jail during his last conversation? Is he inside? What for? He promises to supply Tia Carrere, who indeed turns up in the film, describing Elie as a \"very good friend.'' She may want to change her number.</p><p>There's a 1996 film available on video named \"Me &amp; My Matchmaker,'' about a filmmaker who consults a matchmaker and goes on dates that he films himself. It is incomparably more entertaining, funny, professional, absorbing, honest, revealing, surprising and convincing than \"20 Dates.'' It works wonderfully to demonstrate just how incompetent and annoying \"20 Dates'' really is.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>All those cigarettes, and nobody knows how to smoke. Everybody in \"200 Cigarettes'' smokes nearly all the time, but none of them show any style or flair with their cigarettes. And the cinematographer doesn't know how to light smoke to make it look great.</p><p>He should have studied \"Out of the Past'' (1947), the greatest cigarette-smoking movie of all time. The trick, as demonstrated by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jacques-tourneur\">Jacques Tourneur</a> and his cameraman, Nicholas Musuraca, is to throw a lot of light into the empty space where the characters are going to exhale. When they do, they produce great white clouds of smoke, which express their moods, their personalities and their energy levels. There were guns in \"Out of the Past,'' but the real hostility came when <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/robert-mitchum\">Robert Mitchum</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/kirk-douglas\">Kirk Douglas</a> smoked at each other.</p><p>The cast of \"200 Cigarettes'' reads like a roll call of hot talent. They're the kinds of young stars who are on lots of magazine covers and have Web pages devoted to them, and so they know they will live forever, and are immune to the diseases of smoking. I wish them well. But if they must smoke in the movies, can't they at least be great smokers, like my mother was? When she was smoking, you always knew exactly how she felt because of the way she used her cigarette and her hands and the smoke itself as props to help her express herself. She should have been good; she learned from <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/bette-davis\">Bette Davis</a> movies.</p><p>The stars of \"200 Cigarettes,'' on the other hand, belong to the suck-and-blow school of smokeology. They inhale, not too deeply, and exhale, not too convincingly, and they squint in their closeups while smoke curls up from below the screen. Their smoke emerges as small, pale, noxious gray clouds. When Robert Mitchum exhaled at a guy, the guy ducked out of the way.</p><p>I suppose there will be someone who counts the cigarettes in \"200 Cigarettes,'' to see if there are actually 200. That will at least be something to do during the movie, which is a lame and labored conceit about an assortment of would-be colorful characters on their way to a New Year's Eve party in 1981. Onto the pyre of this dreadful film are thrown the talents of such as <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/ben-affleck\">Ben Affleck</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/casey-affleck\">Casey Affleck</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/janeane-garofalo\">Janeane Garofalo</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/courtney-love\">Courtney Love</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/gaby-hoffmann\">Gaby Hoffmann</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/kate-hudson\">Kate Hudson</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/martha-plimpton\">Martha Plimpton</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/paul-rudd\">Paul Rudd</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/guillermo-diaz\">Guillermo Diaz</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/brian-mccardie\">Brian McCardie</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jay-mohr\">Jay Mohr</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/christina-ricci\">Christina Ricci</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/angela-featherstone\">Angela Featherstone</a> and others equally unlucky.</p><p>Ricci and Love have the kinds of self-contained personalities that hew out living space for their characters no matter where they find themselves, but the others are pretty much lost. The witless screenplay provides its characters with aimless dialogue and meaningless confrontations, and they are dressed not like people who might have been alive in 1981, but like people going to a costume party where 1981 is the theme.</p><p>Seeing a film like this helps you to realize that actors are empty vessels waiting to be filled with characters and dialogue. As people, they are no doubt much smarter and funnier than the cretins in this film. I am reminded of Gene Siskel's bottom-line test for a film: \"Is this movie more entertaining than a documentary of the same people having lunch?'' Here they are contained by small ideas and arch dialogue, and lack the juice of life. Maybe another 200 cigarettes would have helped; coughing would be better than some of this dialogue.</p>",

That is precisely what this film is all about.\" -A voice, probably <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/frank-zappa\">Frank Zappa</a>'s, in \"200 Motels\"</p>\r<p>We have been hearing for a long time that videotape is going to revolutionize filmmaking, and now here is the vanguard of the revolution. Whatever else it may be, Frank Zappa's \"200 Motels\" is a joyous, fanatic, slightly weird experiment in the uses of the color videotape process. If there is more that can be done with videotape, I do not want to be there when they do it.</p>\r<p>The movie is a kind of magical mystery trip through all the motels, concert halls, cities, states and groupies of a road tour of the Mothers of Invention. No attempt is made at documentary accuracy (to make a thunderous understatement). All of the cities are lumped together into Centerville, \"a real nice place to raise your kids up,\" and the sanity of the film can be gauged by the fact that <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/ringo-starr\">Ringo Starr</a> plays Frank Zappa as \"a very large dwarf.\"</p>\r<p>Zappa's mixture of mediums -- rock, electronic music, the Royal Philharmonic, dance, overlapping visuals -- pushes the videotape process almost to its extremes. Zappa's kind of mixture isn't new (Harry Partch's \"Celebrations on the Courthouse Square,\" an experimental 1962 stage production, anticipates everything in \"200 Motels\"). But mixing it on film is new.</p>\r<p>Videotape reportedly allowed Zappa to film the entire movie in about a week, to do a lot of the editing and montage in the camera and to use cheap videotape for his final editing before transferring the whole thing to a surprisingly high-quality 35mm image. Because videotape made it so easy to slosh on more special effects, Zappa wasn't stingy; some people may find the movie's multidimensional feel too overbearing.</p>\r<p>In a way, maybe, overbearing is the word for this movie. It assaults the mind with everything on hand. When there are moments of relative calm -- say, during the animated sequence, or during the rare moments when only one image is on the screen we find ourselves actually catching our mental breath. The movie is so unrelentingly high that you even wish for intermissions.</p>\r<p>Still, the music is there, a lot of it, and because the movie doesn't stop for the music or anything we never get the sense that this is an illustrated album. It is also not another record of a road tour; It breaks with the tradition of \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dont-look-back-1998\">Don&#x27;t Look Back</a>,\" \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mad-dogs-and-englishmen-1971\">Mad Dogs and Englishmen</a>\" and the rock festival movies. It is also not quite in the same family tree as the Beatles movie, but it's in a tree, all right. One with enough branches for everyone but wild tigers snapping at your toes.</p>\r<p>\"200 Motels\" is not the kind of movie you have to see more than once. It is the kind of movie you can barely see once: not because it's simple, but became it's so complicated that you finally realize you aren't meant to get everything and sort everything out. It is a full wall of sight-and-sound input, and the experience of the input -- not its content, is what Zappa's giving us. \"200 Motels\" is out of Howard Johnson by Tinker Bell, with Aquarius setting.</p>",

I felt that the poetry of \"2001\" was precisely in its mystery, and that to explain everything was to ruin everything -- like the little boy who cut open his drum to see what made it bang.</p><p>\"2001\" came out in the late 1960s, that legendary time when yuppies were still hippies, and they went to see the movie a dozen times and slipped up to the front of the theater and lay flat on their backs on the floor, so that the sound-and-light trip in the second half of the movie could wash over them and they could stagger to the exits and whisper \"far out\" to one another in quiet ecstasy. Now comes \"2010,\" a continuation of the Kubrick film, directed by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/peter-hyams\">Peter Hyams</a>, whose background is in more pragmatic projects such as \"Outland,\" the <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/sean-connery\">Sean Connery</a> space station thriller. The story is by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/arthur-c-clarke\">Arthur C. Clarke</a> (who, truth to tell, I always have suspected was a little bewildered by what Kubrick did to his original ideas). \"2010\" is very much a 1980s movie. It doesn't match the poetry and the mystery of the original film, but it does continue the story, and it offers sound, pragmatic explanations for many of the strange and visionary things in \"2001\" that had us arguing endlessly through the nights of 1968.</p><p>This is, in short, a movie that tries to teach ten thousand stars how not to dance. There were times when I almost wanted to cover my ears. Did I really want to know (a) why HAL 9000 disobeyed Dave's orders? or (b) the real reason for the Discovery's original mission? or (c) what the monoliths were trying to tell us? Not exactly. And yet we live in a most practical time, and they say every decade gets the movies it deserves. What we get in \"2010\" is not an artistic triumph, but it is a triumph of hardware, of special effects, of slick, exciting filmmaking. This is a movie that owes more to <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/george-lucas\">George Lucas</a> than to Stanley Kubrick, more to \"Star Wars\" than to Also Sprach Zarathustra. It has an ending that is infuriating, not only in its simplicity, but in its inadequacy to fulfill the sense of anticipation, the sense of wonder we felt at the end of \"2001.\"</p><p>And yet the truth must be told: This is a good movie. Once we've drawn our lines, once we've made it absolutely clear that \"2001\" continues to stand absolutely alone as one of the greatest movies ever made, once we have freed \"2010\" of the comparisons with Kubrick's masterpiece, what we are left with is a good-looking, sharp-edged, entertaining, exciting space opera -- a superior film of the Star Trek genre.</p><p>Because \"2010\" depends so much upon its story, it would be unfair to describe more than the essentials: A joint Soviet-American expedition sets out for the moons of Jupiter to investigate the fate of the Discovery, its crew, and its on-board computer HAL 9000. There is tension on board between the American leader (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/roy-scheider\">Roy Scheider</a>) and the Soviet captain (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/helen-mirren\">Helen Mirren</a>), and it's made worse because back on Earth, the superpowers are on the brink of nuclear war over Central America. If Kubrick sometimes seemed to be making a bloodless movie with faceless characters, Hyams pays a great deal of attention to story and personality. But only one of the best moments in his movie grows out of character (the touching scene where a Soviet and an American hold onto each other for dear life during a terrifying crisis). The other great moments are special-effects achievements: a space walk threatened by vertigo, the awesome presence of Jupiter, and a spectacular flight through the planet's upper atmosphere.</p><p>It is possible that no conclusion to \"2010\" could be altogether satisfying, especially to anyone who still remembers the puzzling, awesome simplicity of the Star Child turning to regard us at the end of \"2001.\" This sequel has its work cut out for it. And the screenplay compounds the difficulty by repeatedly informing us that \"something wonderful\" is about to happen. After we've been told several times about that wonderful prospect, we're ready for something really wonderful, and we don't get it. We get a disappointingly mundane conclusion worthy of a 1950s sci-fi movie, not a sequel to \"2001.\" I, for one, was disappointed that the monoliths would deign to communicate with men at all -- let alone that they would use English, or send their messages via a video screen, like the latest generation of cable news.</p><p>So. You have to make some distinctions in your mind. In one category, \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" remains inviolate, one of the handful of true film masterpieces. In a more temporal sphere, \"2010\" qualifies as superior entertainment, a movie more at home with technique than poetry, with character than with mystery, a movie that explains too much and leaves too little to our sense of wonderment, but a good movie all the same. If I nevertheless sound less than ecstatic, maybe it's because the grave eyes of the \"2001\" Star Child still haunt me, with their promise that perhaps someday man would learn to teach ten thousand stars how to sing.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\">It's not so much that the Earth is destroyed, but that it's done so thoroughly. \"2012,\" the mother of all disaster movies (and the father, and the extended family) spends half an hour on ominous set-up scenes (scientists warn, strange events occur, prophets rant and of course a family is introduced) and then unleashes two hours of cataclysmic special events hammering the Earth relentlessly.</span><br></p><p>This is fun. \"2012\" delivers what it promises, and since no sentient being will buy a ticket expecting anything else, it will be, for its audiences, one of the most satisfactory films of the year. It even has real actors in it. Like all the best disaster movies, it's funniest at its most hysterical. You think you've seen end-of-the-world movies? This one ends the world, stomps on it, grinds it up and spits it out.</p><p>It also continues a recent trend toward the wholesale destruction of famous monuments. <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/roland-emmerich\">Roland Emmerich</a>, the director and co-writer, has been vandalizing monuments for years, as in \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/independence-day-1996\">Independence Day</a>,\" \"The Day After Tomorrow\" and \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/godzilla-1998\">Godzilla</a>.\" I still hold a grudge against him for that one because he provided New York with a Mayor Ebert and didn't have Godzilla step on me and then squish me.</p><p>In all disaster movies, landmarks fall like dominos. The Empire State Building is made of rubber. The Golden Gate Bridge collapses like clockwork. Big Ben ticks his last. The Eiffel Tower? <i>Quel dommage!</i></p><p>Memo to anyone on the National Mall: When the Earth's crust is shifting, don't stand within range of the Washington Monument. Chicago is often spared; we aren't as iconic as Manhattan. There's little in Los Angeles distinctive enough to be destroyed, but it all goes, anyway.</p><p>Emmerich thinks on a big scale. Yes, he destroys regular stuff. It will come as little surprise (because at this writing the film's trailer on YouTube alone had more than 7,591,413 views) that the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy rides a tsunami onto the White House. When St. Peter's Basilica is destroyed, Leonardo's God and Adam are split apart just where their fingers touch (the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel having been moved into St. Peter's for the occasion). Then when Emmerich gets warmed up, the globe's tectonic plates shift thousands of miles, water covers the planet, and a giraffe walks aboard an ark.</p><p>Also on board are the humans chosen to survive, including all the characters who have not already been crushed, drowned or fallen into great crevices opening up in the Earth. These include the heroic Jackson Curtis (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/john-cusack\">John Cusack</a>) and his estranged wife, Kate (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/amanda-peet\">Amanda Peet</a>); President Wilson (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/danny-glover\">Danny Glover</a>), his chief science adviser, Adrian Helmsley (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/chiwetel-ejiofor\">Chiwetel Ejiofor</a>), and his chief of staff, Carl Anheuser (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/oliver-platt\">Oliver Platt</a>).</p><p>Many gigantic arks have been secretly constructed inside the Himalayas by the Chinese, funded by a global consortium, and they're the only chance of the human race surviving. Along with the animals on board, there's the maybe well-named Noah (Liam James). In theory, ark ticketholders represent a cross-section of the globe, chosen democratically. In practice, Carl Anheuser pulls strings to benefit the rich and connected, and wants to strand desperate poor people on the dock. I'm thinking, Emmerich often has a twist when he names villains, like Mayor Ebert from \"Godzilla.\" So how did this villain get his name? What does \"Anheuser\" make you think of?</p><p>Such questions pale by comparison with more alarming events. The tectonic plates shift so violently scientists can almost see them on Google Earth. This havoc requires stupendous special effects. Emmerich's budget was $250 million, and \"2012\" may contain more f/x in total running time than any other film. They're impressive. Not always <i>convincing,</i> because how can the flooding of the Himalayas be made convincing? And Emmerich gives us time to regard the effects and appreciate them, even savor them, unlike the ADD generation and its quick-cutting Bay-cams.</p><p>Emmmerich also constructs dramatic real-scale illusions, as when an earthquake fissure splits a grocery store in half. Cusack is the hero in an elaborate sequence involving his desperate attempts to unblock a jammed hydraulic lift that threatens to sink the ark. He does a lot of heroic stuff in this film, especially for a novelist, like leaping a van over a yawning chasm and riding a small plane through roiling clouds of earthquake dust.</p><p>The bottom line is: The movie gives you your money's worth. Is it a masterpiece? No. Is it one of the year's best? No. Does Emmerich hammer it together with his elbows from parts obtained from the Used Disaster Movie Store? Yes. But is it about as good as a movie in this genre can be? Yes. No doubt it will inflame fears about our demise on Dec. 21, 2012. I'm worried, too. I expect that to be even worse than Y2K.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p><i>Jam yesterday and jam tomorrow, but never jam today.</i> <b>-- Alice in Wonderland</b></p><p>It is always too early or too late for love in a Wong Kar Wai film, and his characters spend their days in yearnings and regrets. \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/in-the-mood-for-love-2001\">In the Mood for Love</a>\" (2001) brought that erotic sadness to a kind of perfection in its story of a man and a woman who live in hotel rooms next to each other, and want to become lovers but never do, because his wife and her husband are lovers, and \"for us to do the same thing would mean we are no better than they are.\" Yes, but no worse, and perhaps happier. Isn't it strange, that most of the truths about love are banal?</p><p>\"2046,\" Wong's new film, is an indirect, oblique continuation of the earlier one. It stars <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/tony-leung\">Tony Leung</a> as Chow Mo Wan, also the name of his character in \"In the Mood for Love,\" and there is a brief role for <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/maggie-cheung\">Maggie Cheung</a>, his co-star in that film; they are not necessarily playing the same characters. There was also a room 2046 in the other film, so there are subterranean connections between the two, but they operate something like the express train to the year 2046 in this one: All memories are there in the future, we are told, but no one has ever returned.</p><p>No one, except for the narrator, who tells us about it. We gather that \"2046\" is the name of a science fiction novel being written by Chow. It is also the room next to his in the hotel where much of this movie takes place -- a room lived in by a series of women he loves. Not coincidentally, 2046 is also the year set by China for the expiration of Hong Kong's quasi-independence from the mainland. Does that make the movie \"2046\" a parable about Hong Kong? You could find parallels, I'm sure, but that doesn't seem to be the point. Chow observes that if he hadn't seen the number 2046 on a room, he wouldn't have started his futuristic novel, and it is just barely possible that Wong is telling us this movie was inspired when he asked himself what happened in Room 2046 after \"In the Mood for Love\" was over. Or before it began. Whatever.</p><p>These speculations are probably of no help in understanding the movie, which exists primarily as a visual style imposed upon beautiful faces; Josef von Sternberg's obsession with <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/marlene-dietrich\">Marlene Dietrich</a> is mirrored here by Wong Kar Wai's fascination with the beauty of <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/ziyi-zhang\">Ziyi Zhang</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/gong-li\">Gong Li</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/faye-wong\">Faye Wong</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/carina-lau\">Carina Lau</a> and Maggie Cheung, and in the careworn eyes and tired smile of Tony Leung, his Bogart. Like von Sternberg, he films his actors mostly in closeup and medium shot, with baroque architectural details in the background, with cigarette smoke constantly coiling through the air. There are a lot of foreground screens (doorjambs, draperies, walls, furniture) to add texture and detail while concealing parts of those faces. The film is in lurid colors, a pulp counterpoint to the elegance of the action. Why Nat King Cole's version of \"The Christmas Song\" is heard two or three times is unclear; his songs were also heard in \"In the Mood for Love.\"</p><p>The story is either briefly summarized, or too complicated to be attempted. Briefly: Chow (Leung) leaves Singapore and Su Li Zhen (Gong Li): \"We have no prospects here, so I'll see how things are in Hong Kong.\" She does not follow. In Hong Kong, he moves into the hotel, and meets a series of women: Lulu (Lau), a prostitute whose murder lingers as a troubling mystery throughout the film; Jing (Wong), daughter of the hotel owner, and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/bai-ling\">Bai Ling</a> (Zhang), a prostitute who becomes Chow's confidante as they drown their sorrows, preferring drink to sex. All of these relationships are seen in carefully composed shots that seem to be remembering the characters more than seeing them. One spectacular shot shows Jing from above and behind, smoking a cigarette and listening to an opera. Its composition is really the subject of the shot.</p><p>An example of complications: Jing is in love with a Japanese man, and earlier in the movie appears as an anime idol in the futuristic story within the story, where she has the same Japanese lover. The Japanese man is the film's original narrator, although later it appears the sci-fi story is being written by Chow, inspired by the present-day Jing and her lover. Whether and why this story is being written, and how the future world of 2046 shares a function with the present Room 2046, is an inviting mystery: Do we define the future as a place in our minds where things can happen later, or be shelved, or be hoped for, or be delayed?</p><p>Since it is by Wong Kar Wai, \"2046\" is visually stunning. He uses three cinematographers but one style, that tries to evoke mood more than meaning. The movie as a whole, unfortunately, never seems sure of itself. It's like a sketchbook. These are images, tones, dialogue and characters that Wong is sure of, and he practices them, but he does not seem very sure why he is making the movie, or where it should end.</p><p>\"2046\" arrived at the last minute at Cannes 2003, after missing its earlier screenings; the final reel reportedly arrived at the airport almost as the first was being shown. It was said to be unfinished, and indeed there were skeletal special effects that now appear in final form, but perhaps it was never really finished in his mind. Perhaps he would have appreciated the luxury that <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/woody-allen\">Woody Allen</a> had with \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-crimes-and-misdemeanors-1989\">Crimes and Misdemeanors</a>\"; he looked at the first cut of the film, threw out the first act, called the actors back and reshot, focusing on what turned out to be the central story. Watching \"2046,\" I wonder what it could possibly mean to anyone not familiar with Wong's work and style. Unlike \"In the Mood for Love,\" it is not a self-contained film, although it's certainly a lovely meander.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>\"21 Grams\" knows all about its story but only lets us discover it a little at a time. Well, every movie does that, but usually they tell their stories in chronological order, so we have the illusion that we're watching as the events happen to the characters. In this film everything has already happened, and it's as if God, or the director, is shuffling the deck after the game is over. Here is the question we have to answer: Is this approach better than telling the same story from beginning to end?</p><p>The film is by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/alejandro-gonzalez-inarritu\">Alejandro <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/gonzalez-inarritu\">Gonzalez Inarritu</a></a>, the almost unreasonably talented Mexican filmmaker whose \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/amores-perros-2001\">Amores Perros</a>\" (2000) was an enormous success. That film intercut three simultaneous stories, all centering on a traffic accident. \"21 Grams\" has three stories and a traffic accident, but the stories move back and forth in time, so that sometimes we know more than the characters, sometimes they know more than we do.</p><p>While the film is a virtuoso accomplishment of construction and editing, the technique has its limitations. Even though modern physics tells that time does not move from the past through the present into the future, entertaining that delusion is how we make sense of our perceptions. And it is invaluable for actors, who build their characters emotionally as events take place. By fracturing his chronology, Inarritu isolates key moments in the lives of his characters, so that they have to stand alone. There is a point at which this stops being a strategy and starts being a stunt.</p><p>\"21 Grams\" tells such a tormenting story, however, that it just about survives its style. It would have been more powerful in chronological order, and even as a puzzle it has a deep effect. Remembering it, we dismiss the structure and recall the events as they happened to the characters, and are moved by its three sad stories of characters faced with the implacable finality of life.</p><p>Because the entire movie depends on withholding information and revealing unexpected connections, it is fair enough to describe the characters but would be wrong to even hint at some of their relationships. <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/sean-penn\">Sean Penn</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/benicio-del-toro\">Benicio <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/del-toro\">Del Toro</a></a> and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/naomi-watts\">Naomi Watts</a> play the key figures, and their spouses are crucial in ways that perhaps should not be described. Penn is Paul, a professor of mathematics (even that fact is withheld for a long time, and comes as a jolt because he does not seem much like one). He is dying of a heart condition, needs a transplant, is badgered by his wife (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/charlotte-gainsbourg\">Charlotte Gainsbourg</a>) to donate sperm so that she can have his baby -- after his death, she does not quite say.</p><p>Benicio Del Toro is Jack, a former convict who now rules his family with firm fundamentalist principles. He is using Jesus as a way of staying off drugs and alcohol; his wife (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/melissa-leo\">Melissa Leo</a>) is grateful for his recovery but dubious about his cure. The third story centers on Christina (Naomi Watts), first seen at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting; she has a husband (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/danny-huston\">Danny Huston</a>) and two daughters, and her life seems to be getting healthier and more stable until an event takes place that eventually links all of the characters in a situation that falls halfway between tragedy and fraught melodrama.</p><p>As you watch this film you are absorbed and involved, sometimes deeply moved; acting does not get much better than the work done here by Penn, Del Toro and Watts, and their individual moments have astonishing impact. But in the closing passages, as the shape of the underlying structure becomes clear, a vague dissatisfaction sets in. You wonder if Inarritu took you the long way around, running up mileage on his storyteller's taxi meter. Imagining how heartbreaking the conclusion would have been if we had arrived at it in the ordinary way by starting at the beginning, I felt as if an unnecessary screen of technique had been placed between the story and the audience. </p><p>Yet I do not want to give the wrong impression: This is an accomplished and effective film despite my reservations. It grips us, moves us, astonishes us. Some of the revelations do benefit by coming as surprises. But artists often grow by learning what to leave out (the great example is Ozu). I have a feeling that Inarritu's fractured technique, which was so impressive in his first film and is not so satisfactory in this one, may inspire impatience a third time around. He is so good that it's time for him to get out of his own way.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>Here's the last movie I was expecting with this title. In other words, \"21 Jump Street\" is pretty good. There seemed to be little demand for a movie spinoff of the crime drama that ran on Fox from 1987 to 1991, and which had an early starring role for <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/johnny-depp\">Johnny Depp</a>. Perhaps realizing that, the filmmakers have abandoned any pretense of being faithful to the series, and turned to a mashup of screwball comedy, action and \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-odd-couple-1968\">The Odd Couple</a>\" formula.</p><p>The couple here are Schmidt and Jenko (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jonah-hill\">Jonah Hill</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/channing-tatum\">Channing Tatum</a>), who were opposites in high school and still are eight years later. In high school, Schmidt was a pudgy nerd who wore braces and couldn't get his mouth to work while trying to ask a girl to the prom. Jenko was a good-looking jock to whom all things came easily; unfortunately, he was the dim bulb in the chandelier. </p><p>In a brief prologue, the movie spares us the tiresome routine where the jock makes life miserable for the nerd; all he does is snicker with everyone else when poor Schmidt gets tongue-tied. They have no reason to be enemies, because they're from different planets. When we meet them again, they're both in the police academy, where Schmidt aces all the exams and fails everything physical, and Jenko does the opposite. That makes them both misfits, and they feel a growing camaraderie. </p><p>After an unpromising start as bicycle-riding cops on park patrol, they're exiled to an undercover unit investigating a dangerous new drug infiltrating a local high school. The captain in charge (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/ice-cube\">Ice Cube</a>) is the typical police veteran who can't believe the incompetence of these losers. I should mention that his name is Dickson  inevitable in a movie papered with dick jokes. The male member, having gone unmentioned during most of the cinema's first 110 years, now co-stars in many comedies.</p><p>But back to the story. It often strikes me that the actors in high school movies look too old. But Schmidt and Jenko look really too old, and the movie isn't shy about pointing that out. Indeed, one of the pleasures of \"21 Jump Street\" is that the screenplay by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/michael-bacall\">Michael Bacall</a> and Jonah Hill is happy to point out all of its improbabilities; the premise is preposterous to begin with, and they run with that.</p><p>Jonah Hill, nominated for an Oscar for \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/moneyball-2011\">Moneyball</a>,\" has become a movie star by demonstrating that it's not so much how you look as how well you look it. He has an endearing appeal in early scenes where he uses close-cropped blond hair in a pathetic attempt to look cool. Hill lost a lot of weight to appear in this movie, but he's one of those guys who will never be described as thin. Channing Tatum, however, has a reverse handicap: He's improbably handsome and has a (real) name that sounds manufactured by a press agent. Their attempt to pass themselves off as brothers supplies a running gag.</p><p>There might have been a temptation to write Schmidt and Jenko as rivals, but it's more effective here to develop them as friends who screw up together. They were pre-enrolled by Capt. Dickson in hand-picked classes, but trouble starts when they can't remember their undercover names and are assigned to each other's classes. That means Schmidt ends up playing Peter Pan in drama class, and Jenko is in advanced chemistry. </p><p>Apparently the conviction that we got high school all wrong is universal. Now Schmidt and Jenko get a fresh start, and Schmidt even gets another chance to ask a girl (sweet <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/brie-larson\">Brie Larson</a>) to the prom. Meanwhile, they're seeking the source of drugs in the high school, which inevitably involves chase scenes and a motorcycle gang including a fat bald guy with high-rider handlebars. As usual, the chases and explosions are boring. </p><p>A disastrous party with abuse is funny, as the movie uses bizarre graphics to illustrate the various stages users go through while using the new mystery drug. What it all comes down to is a funnier and sweeter movie than I had any way of expecting, and the debut of Channing Tatum as an actor who can play comedy. He deadpans so well here he might start looking at Cary Grant movies for remake ideas.</p>",

I'm sure his motivations were heartfelt, but his film is awkward and disjointed, and outstays its welcome.</p><p>It stars <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/amy-acker\">Amy Acker</a> as a dedicated young Army nurse named Caitlin Murphy, assigned to an Army combat field hospital. She considers her profession a vocation, as indeed it is. Vocations and an Army career don't always go hand in hand, and bureaucracy often wins out. Enforcing the Army way is the uptight and unfortunately named Maj. Rose Thorn (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/faye-dunaway\">Faye Dunaway</a>), who seems opposed to innovation, improvisation, inspiration and any other inclinations Caitlin might have in mind.</p><p>Her character is emblematic of the film's problems. I suspect McIntyre was so happy to enlist a star like Dunaway that it never occurred to him she's inappropriate for the role. God help me if I mention the age of an actress, but let me observe that Dunaway is about my age, and I consider myself beyond the age for optimum combat service.</p><p>Even more unfortunately, McIntyre hasn't written a believable character. I doubt Maj. Thorn as a nurse and as an officer. Her primary function seems to be materializing in a self-contained shot while issuing stiff formal announcements somewhat in the tone of a judge at a debutante charity function. She's stiffly poised in many shots; we can almost hear \"Ready for your closeup, Miss Dunaway.\"</p><p>But let's stop right there. Faye Dunaway is a fine actress and has been miscast in a badly written role. Amy Acker and other leading characters have been well-cast in equally badly written roles. In contrast to the energy and life that <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/robert-altman\">Robert Altman</a> brought to his combat hospital in \"MASH,\" this film plays like a series of fond anecdotes trundled onstage without much relationship to one another.</p><p>Some of them strain credulity. McIntyre may indeed know about a nurse who went AWOL with a civilian war correspondent (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/todd-cahoon\">Todd Cahoon</a>) on an unauthorized visit to Cambodia. Such a trip may even have happened. But I didn't believe it.</p><p>I also didn't believe the punctuality with which critically wounded soldiers are rushed onscreen at crucial moments in the action, in order to punctuate dialogue. These emergencies are tended to by medical personnel who seem like nothing so much as actors impersonating characters they've seen on TV.</p><p>McIntyre has enlisted an experienced cast, including <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/ed-begley\">Ed Begley</a> Jr., <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/wes-studi\">Wes Studi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/ben-vereen\">Ben Vereen</a>, and while Vereen creates a convincing human, none of them create convincing characters. How can they? They're pawns on a storyboard. The film lacks a sense of time and place.</p><p>I discover on IMDb that \"21 and a Wakeup\" was actually filmed on location in Vietnam, but its Southeast Asia looks nowhere near as convincing as the locations of Coppola's \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-apocalypse-now-1979\">Apocalypse Now</a>\" and Stone's \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/platoon-1986\">Platoon</a>\" (shot in the Philippines) or Herzog's \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/rescue-dawn-2007\">Rescue Dawn</a>\" (Thailand).</p><p>Maybe I'm being too cynical. Perhaps I'll hear from nurses who served in Vietnam and inform me it was just like this. Even if it was, the film plays like an assortment of stories that someone might tell you, \"You ought to make a movie about that someday.\"</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>\"24 Hour Party People,\" which tells the story of the Manchester music scene from the first Sex Pistols concert until the last bankruptcy, shines with a kind of inspired madness. It is based on fact, but Americans who don't know the facts will have no trouble identifying with the sublime posturing of its hero, a television personality named Tony Wilson, who takes himself seriously in a way that is utterly impossible to take seriously.</p>\r<p>Wilson, a real man, is played by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/steve-coogan\">Steve Coogan</a>, who plays a Wilsonoid TV personality on British TV. That sort of through-the-looking-glass mixing of reality and fancy makes the movie somehow more true than a factual documentary would have been. Wilson is a lanky man with the face of a sincere beagle, a flop of hair over his right eyebrow, and an ability to read banal TV copy as if it has earth-shaking profundity. He's usually the only man in the room wearing a suit and tie, but he looks like he put them on without reading the instructions. He is so heartfelt about his lunacies that we understand, somehow, that his mind deals with contradictions by embracing them.</p>\r<p>As the film opens, Wilson is attending the first, legendary Sex Pistols concert in Manchester, England. Here and elsewhere, director <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/michael-winterbottom\">Michael Winterbottom</a> subtly blends real newsreel footage with fictional characters so they all fit convincingly into the same shot. Wilson is transfixed by the Pistols as they sing \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" and sneer at British tradition. He tells the camera that everyone in the audience will leave the room transformed and inspired, and then the camera pans to show a total of 42 people, two or three of them half-heartedly dancing in the aisles.</p>\r<p>Wilson features the Pistols and other bands on his Manchester TV show. Because of a ban by London TV, his show becomes the only venue for punk rock. Turns out he was right about the Pistols. They let loose something that changed rock music. And they did it in the only way that Wilson could respect, by thoroughly screwing up everything they did, and ending in bankruptcy and failure, followed by Sid Vicious' spectacular murder-suicide flameout. The Sex Pistols became successful because they failed; if they had succeeded, they would have sold out, or become diluted or commercial. I saw Johnny Rotten a few years ago at Sundance, still failing, and it made me feel proud of him.</p>\r<p>Tony Wilson, who preaches \"anarchism\" not as a political position but as an emotional state, knows he has seen the future. He joins with two partners to form Factory Records, which would become one of the most important and least financially successful recording companies in history, and joyously signs the contract in his blood (while declaring \"we will have no contracts\"). His bands include Joy Division (renamed New Order after the suicide of its lead singer) and Happy Mondays. His company opens a rave club, the Hacienda, which goes broke because the customers ignore the cash bars and spend all their money on Ecstasy.</p>\r<p>Wilson hardly cares. When the club closes, he addresses the final night's crowd: \"Before you leave, I ask you to invade the offices and loot them.\" When he meets with investors who want to buy Factory Records, they are startled to learn he has nothing to sell--no contracts, no back catalog, nothing. \"We are not really a company,\" he explains helpfully. \"We are an experiment in human nature. I protected myself from the dilemma of selling out by having nothing to sell.\" This is a lovable character, all the more so because his conversation uses the offhand goofy non-sequiturs of real speech, instead of being channeled into a narrow lane of movie dialogue. The writer, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/frank-cottrell-boyce\">Frank Cottrell Boyce</a>, gives Wilson a distinctive voice we come to love. \"I went to Cambridge University!\" he tells one of his broadcast bosses. \"I'm a serious journalist, living in one of the most important times in human history.\" Yes, but the next day he's interviewing a midget elephant trainer. He explains how the invention of broccoli funded the James Bond movies (there is a shred of truth there, actually). He quotes Plutarch and William Blake, he says one of his singers is a poet equal to Yeats, he looks at empty concert halls and observes hopefully that there were only 12 people at the Last Supper (13, actually, counting the talent). And he is courageous in the face of daunting setbacks, pushing on optimistically into higher realms of failure.</p>\r<p>The movie works so well because it evokes genuine, not manufactured, nostalgia. It records a time when the inmates ran the asylum, when music lovers got away with murder. It loves its characters. It understands what the Sex Pistols started, and what the 1990s destroyed. And it gets a certain tone right. It kids itself. At one point, Wilson looks straight at the camera and tells us that a scene is missing, \"but it will probably be on the DVD.\" As the screenwriter of an ill-fated Sex Pistols movie, I met Rotten, Vicious, Paul Cook, Steve Jones and their infamous manager, Malcolm McLaren, and brushed the fringe of their world. I could see there was no plan, no strategy, no philosophy, just an attitude. If a book on the Sex Pistols had an upraised middle finger on the cover, it wouldn't need any words inside. And yet Tony Wilson goes to see the Pistols and sees before him a delirious opportunity to--to what? Well, obviously, to live in one of the most important times in human history, and to make your mark on it by going down in glorious flames.</p>",

She missed her daughter's first birthday and the first steps, because she was arrested trying to jump over a subway turnstile with a birthday present. And she yelled at the cop, because she was so frustrated after a crazy day at work and then the struggle to find the toy, one of those overnight sensations that inspire buying panics at Toys-R-Us.</p><p>Grace, played at top speed by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/rosie-perez\">Rosie Perez</a>, is a TV producer just finishing her first year as a working mom. She's at the end of her rope.</p><p>First came the surprise news that she was pregnant. Then her husband, the co-host of a local morning show, announced her pregnancy on TV. Then the executive producer (Patti LuPone) found out she's expected to deliver in November: \"During sweeps!'' Then the show made her pregnancy a ratings-winner on cable, and it got picked up by a network. Meanwhile, Grace has been running herself ragged, trying to keep up.</p><p>Her mom smiles at Grace's faith that she can be a mother and hold a full-time job: \"I remember when you were born. I was gonna write my novel while you slept.'' But Grace tries to juggle both lives, although hiring a nanny is an alarming experience: \"So far all we've met are Nazi nurses, and emotionally disturbed women with no skills.'' To balance her experience, there's the case of her new assistant, Madeline (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/marianne-jean-baptiste\">Marianne Jean-Baptiste</a>), who is returning to the workforce after taking time out for a family, and whose husband (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/wendell-pierce\">Wendell Pierce</a>) is playing househusband, not without grumbles.</p><p>\"The 24 Hour Woman'' is a message picture wrapped inside a screwball comedy, with an touch of satire aimed at TV talk shows. It doesn't all work, but it happens so fast we don't get stuck in the awkward parts. Rosie Perez's Grace is the engine that pulls the story, with so much energy she seems to vibrate. Some will see her character as exaggerated. Not me. She's half Brooklynite-half TV producer, and from what I've seen of both species, hyperactivity is built in.</p><p>The only person on the show more driven than Grace is the Patti LuPone character, named Joan Marshall, who has true tunnel vision and cares only about ratings and programming gimmicks (one of her segment titles: \"Romancing the Stone: How to Kick-Start Your Man's Love Machine''). The message of the movie is that new mothers who want to work are pretty much on their own. They get more lip-service than real help from their husbands, and fellow females at work are running too hard to pause for sisterhood. \"Take your baby and go home,'' Joan shouts at her at one point. \"I got a show to do here.'' The movie's not an idealized Ms. magazine vision of a working mom breast-feeding between conference calls. Its message is more Darwinian: Motherhood releases powerful drives in a woman, which are good for her children but bad for her career. No matter how hard Grace tries, she can't get rid of the guilt when she's not with her baby. And the other people in her life, who do not share these mother's instincts, simply do not care as much or at all.</p><p>The movie was directed and co-written by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/nancy-savoca\">Nancy Savoca</a>, who in three earlier films also considered social institutions through a woman's eyes. Her \"True Love'' (1989) was about a bride who suddenly understood that she was being sacrificed on the altar of her family's expectations. Her \"Dogfight'' (1991) was about a woman who discovers she has been asked out on a date as part of a contest--four guys on their way to Vietnam are trying to see who can pick up the homeliest girl. And \"Household Saints'' (1993) was about a grandmother who was a devout Catholic, a mother and a husband who had drifted into secular ways, and a granddaughter who literally wanted to be a saint. Behavior that would have seemed admirable to the grandmother seemed like insanity to the mother.</p><p>Now comes \"The 24 Hour Woman,'' which probably contains some of Savoca's own experiences. Her casting of Rosie Perez is a good one, because Perez is the most grounded of actors; you can't find the slightest hint of theory or conceit in her performances, which seem founded on total identification with character. She isn't a \"working woman'' or a \"Puerto Rican yuppie,'' but simply Grace Santos, with her marriage, her kid and her job. She doesn't have time for abstractions.</p><p>This isn't the kind of movie that would make a working woman think twice about having a child. It would make her think twice about having a job. If that's reactionary, then tough luck: What's a mom going to do when little Lily starts crying and only one person can comfort her?</p>",

Odd, since for the practicing alcoholic, daily life is mostly unchanging, an attempt to negotiate daily responsibilities while drinking enough but not too much. When this attempt fails, as it often does, it results in events that the drunk thinks make him colorful. True variety comes only with sobriety. Plus, now he can remember it.</p><p>This is the lesson learned by Gwen Cummings, the character played by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/sandra-bullock\">Sandra Bullock</a> in \"28 Days.\" As the story opens, her life is either wild and crazy or confused and sad, depending on where you stand. She parties all night with her boyfriend Jasper (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/dominic-west\">Dominic West</a>). After the clubs, the drinks, the designer drugs, they commence what may turn out to be sex, if they can stay awake long enough. Then a candle starts a fire, which they extinguish with champagne. What a ball.</p><p>In the morning, Gwen's day begins with a pass at the refrigerator so smooth and practiced she hardly seems to even open it while extracting a cold beer. Gwen is an accident waiting to happen--to herself or innocent bystanders. Her victim is her sister Lily (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/elizabeth-perkins\">Elizabeth Perkins</a>). \"Gwen, you make it impossible to love you,\" Lily says when she arrives late at the church for Lily's wedding. At the reception, Gwen delivers an insulting toast, knocks over the cake while dancing, steals a limousine to go buy another cake and crashes it into a house. Not a good day.</p><p>Cut to Serenity Glen, where Gwen has been sentenced to 28 days of rehab in lieu of jail time. The PA system makes a running commentary out of \"MASH\"-style announcements. The patients do a lot of peppy group singing (too much, if you ask me). \"I don't have a health problem,\" Gwen protests. \"I play Ultimate Frisbee twice a week.\" The patients include the usual cuckoo's nest of colorful characters, although they're a little more plausible than in most inmate populations.

And Andrea (Azura Skye), Gwen's teenage roommate.</p><p>Gwen's counselor is Cornell, played by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/steve-buscemi\">Steve Buscemi</a>, who inspires a grin when we see him in a movie because he's usually good for strange scenes and dialogue. Not this time; he plays the role straight, revealing toughness and a certain weary experience, as if all of Gwen's cherished kookiness is for him a very, very old joke. There's a nice scene where she says exactly the wrong things to him before discovering he's her counselor.</p><p>Another fellow patient is Eddie Boone (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/viggo-mortensen\">Viggo Mortensen</a>), a baseball pitcher with a substance abuse problem. Of course they begin a tentative, unstated courtship. Jasper, on weekend visits, misunderstands (\"Where are all the celebrities?\" he asks on his first arrival, looking around for <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/elizabeth-taylor\">Elizabeth Taylor</a>). Of course there is a fight. This subplot is predictable, but made perceptive because Gwen and Eddie illustrate the lifeboat mentality in which sailors on the ship of rehab have only each other to cling to.</p><p>The movie was written by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/susannah-grant\">Susannah Grant</a>, who also wrote Julia Roberts' hit film \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/erin-brockovich-2000\">Erin Brockovich</a>.\" I differed with \"Erin\" for the same reason I like \"28 Days\": the tone of the central character. I found that Roberts, enormously likable although she is, upstaged the material in \"Erin Brockovich\" by unwise costume choices and scenes that were too obviously intended as showcases. Bullock brings a kind of ground-level vulnerability to \"28 Days\" that doesn't make her into a victim but simply into one more suitable case for treatment. Bullock, like Roberts, is likable, but in \"28 Days\" at least that's not the point.</p><p>Note: \"28 Days\" is rated PG-13 and might be effective as a cautionary tale for teens.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>Activists set lab animals free from their cages--only to learn, too late, that they're infected with a \"rage\" virus that turns them into frothing, savage killers. The virus quickly spreads to human beings, and when a man named Jim (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/cillian-murphy\">Cillian Murphy</a>) awakens in an empty hospital and walks outside, he finds a deserted London. In a series of astonishing shots, he wanders Piccadilly Circus and crosses Westminster Bridge with not another person in sight, learning from old wind-blown newspapers of a virus that turned humanity against itself.</p><p>So opens \"28 Days Later,\" which begins as a great science fiction film and continues as an intriguing study of human nature. The ending is disappointing--an action shoot-out, with characters chasing one another through the headquarters of a rogue Army unit--but for most of the way, it's a great ride. I suppose movies like this have to end with the good and evil characters in a final struggle. The audience wouldn't stand for everybody being dead at the end, even though that's the story's logical outcome.</p><p>Director <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/danny-boyle\">Danny Boyle</a> (\"Train-spotting\") shoots on video to give his film an immediate, documentary feel, and also no doubt to make it affordable; a more expensive film would have had more standard action heroes, and less time to develop the quirky characters. Spend enough money on this story, and it would have the depth of \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/armageddon-1998\">Armageddon</a>.\" Alex Garland's screenplay develops characters who seem to have a reality apart from their role in the plot--whose personalities help decide what they do, and why.</p><p>Jim is the everyman, a bicycle messenger whose nearly fatal traffic accident probably saves his life. Wandering London, shouting (unwisely) for anyone else, he eventually encounters Selena (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/naomie-harris\">Naomie Harris</a>) and Mark (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/noah-huntley\">Noah Huntley</a>), who have avoided infection and explain the situation. (Mark: \"OK, Jim, I've got some bad news.\") Selena, a tough-minded black woman who is a realist, says the virus had spread to France and America before the news broadcasts ended; if someone is infected, she explains, you have 20 seconds to kill them before they turn into a berserk, devouring zombie.</p><p>That 20-second limit serves three valuable story purposes: (a) It has us counting \"12 ... 11 ... 10\" in our minds at one crucial moment; (b) it eliminates the standard story device where a character can keep his infection secret; and (c) it requires the quick elimination of characters we like, dramatizing the merciless nature of the plague.</p><p>Darwinians will observe that a virus that acts within 20 seconds will not be an efficient survivor; the host population will soon be dead--and along with it, the virus. I think the movie's answer to this objection is that the \"rage virus\" did not evolve in the usual way, but was created through genetic manipulation in the Cambridge laboratory where the story begins.</p><p>Not that we are thinking much about evolution during the movie's engrossing central passages. Selena becomes the dominant member of the group, the toughest and least sentimental, enforcing a hard-boiled survivalist line. Good-hearted Jim would probably have died if he hadn't met her. Eventually they encounter two other survivors: A big, genial man named Frank (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/brendan-gleeson\">Brendan Gleeson</a>) and his teenage daughter Hannah (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/megan-burns\">Megan Burns</a>). They're barricaded in a high-rise apartment, and use their hand-cranked radio to pick up a radio broadcast from an Army unit near Manchester. Should they trust the broadcast and travel to what is described as a safe zone? The broadcast reminded me of that forlorn radio signal from the Northern Hemisphere that was picked up in post-A-bomb Australia in \"On the Beach.\" After some discussion, the group decides to take the risk, and they use Frank's taxi to drive to Manchester. This involves an extremely improbable sequence in which the taxi seems abler to climb over gridlocked cars in a tunnel, and another scene in which a wave of countless rats flees from zombies.</p><p>Those surviving zombies raise the question: How long can you live once you have the virus? Since London seems empty at the beginning, presumably the zombies we see were survivors until fairly recently. Another question: Since they run in packs, why don't they attack one another? That one, the movie doesn't have an answer for.</p><p>The Manchester roadblock, which is indeed maintained by an uninfected Army unit, sets up the third act, which doesn't live up to the promise of the first two. The officer in charge. Maj. Henry West (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/christopher-eccleston\">Christopher Eccleston</a>) invites them to join his men at one of those creepy movie dinners where the hosts are so genial that the guests get suspicious. And then... see for yourself.</p><p>Naomie Harris, a newcomer, is convincing as Selena, the rock at the center of the storm. We come to realize she was not born tough, but has made the necessary adjustments to the situation. In a lesser movie, there would be a love scene between Selena and Jim, but here the movie finds the right tone in a moment where she pecks him on the cheek, and he blushes. There is also a touching scene where she offers Valium to young Hannah. They are facing a cruel situation. \"To kill myself?\" Hannah asks. \"No. So you won't care as much.\" The conclusion is pretty standard. I can understand why Boyle avoided having everyone dead at the end, but I wish he'd had the nerve that <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/john-sayles\">John Sayles</a> showed in \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/limbo-1999\">Limbo</a>\" with his open ending. My imagination is just diabolical enough that when that jet fighter appears toward the end, I wish it had appeared, circled back--and opened fire.</p><p>But then I'm never satisfied. \"28 Days Later\" is a tough, smart, ingenious movie that leads its characters into situations where everything depends on their (and our) understanding of human nature.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>One of my favorite things on television is the news coverage of lucky lottery winners. There they are, sitting in their living rooms, holding the winning ticket and expounding on their plans. They get a mike shoved in their faces and suddenly theyre benevolent investors and financiers, announcing good deeds such as buying their mother a home or paying off their in-laws pickup truck.</p>\r<p>I always have the sense that theres more than meets the eye in those stories, and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/george-gallo\">George Gallo</a>s 29th Street has the same conviction. This is more or less the true story of a man named <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/frank-pesce\">Frank Pesce</a> Jr., who was born with good luck and tormented by it all of his life, right up until the time the worst possible thing happened to him, which was that he won the 1976 New York State Lottery. Why would that be a terrible thing? I cant say, without revealing too many of the movies surprises, but trust me. To paraphrase a famous line from <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-raging-bull-1980\">Raging Bull</a>, if he loses, he loses, and if he wins, he loses.</p>\r<p>The movie stars the feckless <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/anthony-lapaglia\">Anthony LaPaglia</a> as Frank Jr., and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/danny-aiello\">Danny Aiello</a> as his father, whose luck is as bad as his sons is good. The family lives together in a crowded row house, in riotous good will, held more or less in line by Mrs. Pesce (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/lainie-kazan\">Lainie Kazan</a>), who sings operatic arias in the kitchen while the men sit in the next room and look at her in sheer love and wonderment. Frank Sr.s great dream in life is to move his family to Queens, and his great passion is for his lawn (he chases away cats because of a belief that their body heat can burn holes in the grass).</p>\r<p>The Pesces in this movie have their origins in real people (indeed, the real Frank Jr. is a character actor who appears as his own older brother, Vito), but in 29th Street they seem to emerge mostly from the long tradition of Italian-Americans in the movies.</p>\r<p>They are loosely related to the characters in <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-goodfellas-1991\">GoodFellas</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/married-to-the-mob-1988\">Married to the Mob</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/true-love-1989\">True Love</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/spike-of-bensonhurst-1988\">Spike of Bensonhurst</a>, and Aiello, as the head of the family, has all the necessary warmth and passion to lead them.</p>\r<p>The great cross of his life is his sons good luck. Even Frank Jr.s bad luck is good luck, as when hes stabbed in a fight with a girl but then the surgeons discover a tumor in its earliest stages, and are able to remove it. If he hadnt been stabbed, who knows what mischief that tumor might have caused? His good luck almost seems to exhibit a sense of humor, as when he keeps trying to lose his car, so he can report it stolen, but it keeps being found and returned to him.</p>\r<p>Then he enters the first New York State Lottery. And of course he is among the finalists for the big prize. His problem is, by then he no longer possesses the ticket, because of some urgent dealings with mobsters who are on his fathers case. And so, when he wins . . .</p>\r<p>Well, I have a slight problem with what happens then. The ex-planation at the end of the movie is so neat and tidy that I couldnt really believe it, especially not after the movie showed me two different explanations for what happened. The ending is so unlikely, indeed, that I suspect it is the literal truth, and that such a thing did happen, exactly like that, to the real Frank Pesce Jr. No screenwriter could have dreamed it up.</p>\r<p>Still, Anthony LaPaglia struggles manfully with it, and makes it about as convincing as it can be. If you saw a little-noticed 1990 <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/alan-alda\">Alan Alda</a> movie named Betsys Wedding, you will remember LaPaglia, who stole the show as a Mafioso who fell hopelessly in love with <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/ally-sheedy\">Ally Sheedy</a>, as a cop. Again this time, he shows a genuine comic gift. The ending aside, 29th Street is a movie of considerable energy and good humor, with the expansive Aiello, the uninhibited Kazan and the screwy LaPaglia having a lot of fun with the material.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p><a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/tom-tykwer\">Tom Tykwer</a>'s \"3,\" also known as \"Three\" or \"Drei,\" is an art film treatment of what in more vulgar genres would be called a threesome. It contains a good many sex scenes, but have you noticed recently how many orgasms in the movies are desperate, aggressive or sad  anything but ecstatic? The most that can be said for the characters here is they all seem mighty pleased.</p><p>The movie involves a 40-ish couple in Berlin who have a \"committed relationship\" but are not married because of all the usual weaselly reasons. Hanna (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/sophie-rois\">Sophie Rois</a>) hosts a TV talk show about culture. Simon (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/sebastian-schipper\">Sebastian Schipper</a>) runs a company that constructs large works of art for sculptors and suchlike. They get along warmly enough after 20 years together, but the excitement is fading. One night Hanna goes out for drinks after a show, and Simon learns from a doctor that he has testicular cancer. The doc says it's curable but surgery should be done quickly  like, now. </p><p>Simon can't get Sophie on her cell phone. She is preoccupied. The removal of one of Simon's precious spheres is required, and we learn along with Simon that this surgery is now done under local anesthetic; presumably just as a woman might want to be conscious during childbirth, a man wouldn't want to miss the halving of his family jewels. The guilty tumor is deposited in a steel pan with a little \"clink.\" I would have expected more of a little plop. This Simon, what a man.</p><p>Hanna has met a man named Adam (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/devid-striesow\">Devid Striesow</a>). One thing leads to another, and without planning to, they have intercourse. Neither one was hungering for sex, but it seemed like a good idea at the time, and if anything, it makes Hanna friendlier with Simon after his inventory has been reduced. Not long after, in a modernistic and isolated swimming pool, Simon meets Adam in the locker room and somehow the conversation gets around to losing testicles. Adam asks for a look, and before long, they're having sex.</p><p>What you need to know about Adam is that he is not sex mad, not a predator, not aggressive. We sense he is a very nice man with a friendly smile. He isn't bisexual so much as accommodating. We learn a little more about the lives of Simon and Hanna in visual displays by director Tom Tykwer (\"Run, Lola, Run\") that use flashbacks, imaginings and possibilities, mixed up with snatches of everyday life, bites of television, and a compressed edition of the two parallel love affairs as they develop.</p><p>What's crucial is that nice young Adam doesn't have the slightest idea Hanna and Simon are a couple. He likes them both, they both like him, but it's an excellent question how they'd all feel if the cards were on the table. \"3\" is, in short, a melodrama that otherwise could easily become a farce. But Tykwer reins in the performances; his characters are intelligent, have gone into this situation with no desire to hurt anyone and are involved in the kind of realignment that can happen in midlife. </p><p>The film is successful in an absorbing sort of way, but underwhelming. Devid Striesow's performance as Adam is important in its modulation. More affection is involved than lust, more curiosity than need. If he's not with the one he loves, he loves the one he's with.</p>",

No one with the slightest knowledge of human nature will be able to find a single moment of this film to believe. It is all formula, every last miserable frame of it.</p><p>The movie tells the story of three bachelors who live in a luxurious Paris flat, where life is an endless round of parties and wenching. One of the three, a flight attendant, flies off to the Far East, telling his flatmates that a package will be dropped off for him.</p><p>The next day, a basket with an infant girl is delivered to their door.</p><p>A note says this is the love child of the absent attendant. After several minutes of idiotic honks and squeaks of protest, the two bachelors decide to try to care for the child, which involves getting lots of poo (their word) all over themselves as they change her diapers. Then there are trips to the pharmacist to learn about baby formulas. The baby cries at night, the bachelors' sex lives are disrupted, and so forth.</p><p>There is a complication, a particularly offensive one: It turns out that the baby was not the package that the flight attendant thought would be dropped off. No, he was thinking of a shipment of heroin. A gang turns up to collect the heroin, which has been misplaced, and then the police get involved, and the heroin is hidden in the baby's diapers - which is the first place any competent narc would search.</p><p>Although heroin is a mean and evil drug, it exists in this movie only because the plot needs it. That helps demonstrate how witless the plot is; almost any other criminal contraband would have been less disturbing. Meanwhile, we learn that the baby's mother has gone off to the States for six months. She left her child with a note on the doorstep, not even bothering to ring the bell, nor does she telephone during the next six months to see how the kid is. That demonstrates how witless she is.</p><p>There are scenes in this movie that cry out against common sense.</p><p>For example, when the airline steward returns home, his roommates are holding a baby, and talking sarcastically about his \"package,\" but we have to wait through line after line of uncomprehending, willfully idiotic dialogue before the steward finally figures out that the baby and the package are one and the same.</p><p>We know, of course, what will happen by the end of this movie. The men will fall in love with the baby. The mother will return. She will take the baby back. The men will miss her. There will be an emotional reconciliation, at which it is demonstrated that bird-brained bachelor heroin dealers have hearts of gold. I guess the three men, the mother and the baby are supposed to live happily ever after.</p><p>I hated every second of this movie because it was so blind to psychology and reality, and so willing to settle for every relentless cliche and dim-witted, knee-jerk emotional response in the book. The movie is single-minded in its determination to shut out every plausible question, every shred of logic, every emotion except for the lachrymose sentimentality of its brain-damaged heroes. The only sparks of life in the film are supplied by the two little girls who portray the baby.</p><p>Now comes the really bad news. Incredibly, the rights to make an American version of this movie have been purchased by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/walt-disney\">Walt Disney</a> Studios. That raises two questions: (1) Why is the movie thought to be worth remaking? and (2) Why spend money for the rights, when it is clear as day that \"3 Men and a Cradle\" has been stolen - lock, stock and barrel - from John Ford's Western classic \"Three Godfathers,\" a 1948 masterpiece in which outlaws <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/john-wayne\">John Wayne</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/harry-carey\">Harry Carey</a> Jr. and Pedro Armendariz find an abandoned baby in the desert and try to get it to safety? The sight of Wayne applying wagon grease to the little tyke's behind is all by itself worth more than every foot of this miserable French retread. If you're going to remake a movie, at least remake the original, not the ripoff.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>\"3 Ninjas Kick Back\" is a kids' movie that seems to have been assembled from spare parts of \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-goonies-1985\">The Goonies</a>,\" \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/bad-news-bears-2005\">Bad News Bears</a>\" and \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/home-alone-1990\">Home Alone</a>.\" Somebody asks the heroes if their ambition is to be \"Teenage Mutant Wannabes,\" and that's not far off. It's the kind of movie where a fat kid on a Little League team eats a can of beans before going up to bat, hits a home run, passes gas as he runs the bases - and all the players on the other team faint. Not your real sophisticated humor.</p><p>The movie begins in an idyllic American suburb, where three brothers named Colt, Rocky and Tum Tum are being trained as junior ninja warriors by their wise old Japanese-American grandfather (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/victor-wong\">Victor Wong</a>). They're better at martial arts than baseball, and their team is facing a crisis just when Grandpa decides it's time to dust off a 50-year-old ceremonial knife and return it to Japan, to be used as a prize in a ninja tournament.</p><p>Cut to Japan, where Grandpa's enemy in a tournament half a century ago is now a powerful tycoon who wants to get his hands on the knife. Cut back to America, where the evil tycoon's nephew and his two buddies play in a very bad rock band named Teenage Vomit. The nephew wears a long blond wig, one of his buddies has what looks like a fright wig, and when one of them stops the other two run into him.</p><p>What's shaping up here is the Three Ninjas vs. the Three Stooges.</p><p>The evil gang believes the knife is hidden in Grandpa's cabin, and stage a raid. The good kids booby-trap the cabin. (Either they or their screenwriters have carefully studied \"Home Alone.\") The knife is safe. Grandpa leaves for Japan with the wrong flight bag, so when it is stolen the knife is not inside. His grandchildren follow him to Japan. So does Teenage Vomit, setting the stage for a showdown.</p><p>It turns out the tycoon has his own private ninja army, dressed in black and training under rigid discipline. Strange, isn't it, that he would import his goofy nephew and his buddies when he could be deploying skilled ninjas? But never mind: The oldest grandkid gets involved in a martial arts tournament against an opponent who wears a mask, wins, takes off the mask, and shakes long hair free to be revealed as, gasp! . . . A Girl! (This development will not startle readers of Ebert's Little Movie Glossary, where it is identified as the Disguised Surprise Gender Switch.) The girl, whose name is Miyo (Caroline Junko King) immediately becomes a pal of the heroes, who teach her to play baseball, a game she seems completely unfamiliar with, despite the fact that Japan is as obsessed with the sport as America. Meanwhile, the tycoon orders his nephew's gang to kidnap the visitors, while Grandpa languishes in a hospital under the thumb of a sadistic nurse - who has also read Ebert's Little Glossary and knows the Traction Action Rule, which states that any patient with limb injuries must eventually have the injured limb twisted painfully by a visitor to the bedside.</p><p>The movie seems determined to leave no base uncovered. After reaching the climax of the knife business in Japan, the story returns to America for a showdown Little League game, in which it looks like the good guys are going to lose, until an important hit is caught, in a miraculous play, by a mysterious new team member whose number isn't in the program, and who is disguised by a cap, dark glasses, etc., but who after catching the ball whips off her cap so her hair can blow free - and is revealed as, gasp!., etc.</p><p>Who was this movie made for? Not for me, that's sure, but I have a hunch younger kids will find it satisfying.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\">A gaunt stranger haunts the streets of Barrow, Alaska, warning: \"That cold ain't the weather. That's Death approaching.\" Since Barrow is said to be the northernmost town in America, 300 miles of roadless wilderness from its closest neighbor, and 30 days of continuous sunless night are commencing, I expected someone to reply, \"You could have fooled me. I thought it was the weather.\"</span><br></p><p>But, yes, it is Death, which is very cold. In \"30 Days of Night,\" Barrow will soon be invaded by vampires, who have apparently trekked across the 300 miles of ice and snow wearing their street clothes. You'd think they could find easier blood to drink in Fairbanks or Anchorage, but sunlight is fatal to vampires, and so the month of perpetual night in Barrow lures them like Canadians to Florida.</p><p>Their method of attack is the standard one in creature features. They move with loud <i>whooshes</i> at lightning speed when you can't quite see them, and with ungainly lurches when you can. They are a miserable lot. Count Dracula at least had style and a sense of personal destiny; these guys are merely obsessed with their next meal. They don't even speak that elegant Hammer Films English; they talk like a garbled transmission played backward: \"<i>Qwe!nt raqulo*gg brop#sith!\"</i> The movie, which speaks their language, helpfully provides subtitles. It is intriguing to think of newly converted vampires attending language classes at Berlitz, since I do not think Chomsky's theories of speech apply to the Undead.</p><p>But I could go on like this all day -- or night, that is. Something about vampire movies brings out the one-liners in me, unless they are directed by Dreyer, Murnau or Herzog. The fact is, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/david-slade\">David Slade</a>'s \"30 Days of Night\" is a better than average example of the genre, even if it follows the time-honored pattern of supplying a macho man who gathers a hardy band in hiding while the vampires snuffle about. <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/josh-hartnett\">Josh Hartnett</a> plays the local sheriff, who teams up with his estranged wife, Stella (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/melissa-george\">Melissa George</a>), another law enforcer, who missed the last flight out of town. (Planes can't land in Barrow at night. Don't ask me why.)</p><p>The survivors hide in an attic, plunder a supermarket and scheme and plot to outwit the vampires; this time, at least, there is no crusty old-timer to say he's going to make a run for it, because of the 300 miles of snow, etc. The vampires stalk the frigid streets, led by Marlow (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/danny-huston\">Danny Huston</a>, who is actually quite convincing in the role).</p><p>The most interesting aspect of the movie is Barrow itself. Folks are drawn closer together when they live in such extreme circumstances, although how they support themselves is a mystery to me. No mention of drilling for oil, maintaining the pipeline, guarding against missile attacks, hunting whales, carving scrimshaw, etc. They seem to have settled there out of sheer perversity, and I guess they support themselves by selling stuff to one another.</p><p>I award the movie two and a half stars because it is well-made, well-photographed and plausibly acted, and is better than it needs to be. Its director, David Slade, previously made the stunningly good \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/hard-candy-2006\">Hard Candy</a>.\" Although his vampires quickly disable the town generators, there seems to be a full moon for 30 days, bathing the streets in cold light. Otherwise, this would be a radio play. I have pretty much reached my quota for vampire movies, but I shouldn't hold that against this one. If you haven't seen too many, you might like it.</p><p>If you are a horror fan, you will love it, and in the interest of equal time for the defense, I close with evocative prose by the critic Tristan Sinns from his five-dagger (out of five) review on <i>DreadCentral.com:</i> \" '30 Days of Night' grabs this hoary monster by the throat, pumps it full of the thick rich blood of life, and shoves it out to greet you, eat you and coat you in glorious mists of red firing from oh-so-many newly exposed arterial sprays.\"</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>I should do a little more research, but I think \"30 Minutes or Less\" is the first R-rated slacker comedy based on a true recent story in which a man was blown up by a bomb strapped around his neck. You may recall the 2003 case of a pizza delivery man who dreamed up a scheme to rob a bank with a bomb strapped on him. He thought it was fake, but his treacherous partners double-crossed him.</p><p>Now here is a movie about a guy who drives for a Grand Rapids, Mich., pizzeria that promises your pizza in 30 minutes or less. That of course establishes him as a breakneck stunt driver, which will be useful in the inevitable chase scene. The driver, named Nick, is played by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jesse-eisenberg\">Jesse Eisenberg</a>, in an unfortunate career move after \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-social-network-2010\">The Social Network</a>.\" He was so good in that film that it is impossible to believe him as a character a dumb as Nick. For comparison, try to imagine <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/george-clooney\">George Clooney</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/ben-kingsley\">Ben Kingsley</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/john-malkovich\">John Malkovich</a> playing the Three Stooges.</p><p>His best buddy is Chet (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/aziz-ansari\">Aziz Ansari</a>), who goes ballistic when he discovers Nick has slept with his beautiful twin sister, Kate (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/dilshad-vadsaria\">Dilshad Vadsaria</a>). That causes complications when Nick turns to Chet in desperation with a bomb strapped to his chest.</p><p>How did this happen? We meet two slacker layabouts, Dwayne (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/danny-mcbride\">Danny McBride</a>) and Travis (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/nick-swardson\">Nick Swardson</a>). Hapless, luckless and witless, they make 10 bucks an hour cleaning the pool of Dwayne's father (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/fred-ward\">Fred Ward</a>).</p><p>One night during a lap dance, Dwayne mentions his dad is a lottery winner. Juicy (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/bianca-kajlich\">Bianca Kajlich</a>), the dancer, then promises that Dwayne's lap need never be untenanted again if he steals a million from his dad. She even suggests a hit man from Detroit, Chango (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/michael-pena\">Michael Pena</a>). </p><p>Their brainstorm: Order a pizza, strap a bomb to the guy and have him rob a bank to get them the money to pay the hit man, who will then kill the lottery-winning dad. Need I explain that everyone involved in this plot is stupid enough to go along with it?</p><p>The time bomb deadline ramps up the urgency and leads to great desperation. The movie's strategic error is to set the deadline too far in the future. There is something annoying about a comedy where a guy is strapped to a bomb and nevertheless has time to spare for off-topic shouting matches with his best buddy. A buddy comedy loses some of its charm in a situation like that.</p><p>Certain moments in the film elicit mechanical laughs. The chase is well-staged, but then staging a good chase, in this era of CGI, is becoming routine. Eisenberg is a good actor, which may be why he's wrong for this dumb comedy. The tension over his buddy's sister feels contrived, and only one line is devoted to the intriguing implications that she's a twin sister.</p><p>Oh, and the only purpose of Kate is to be beautiful. She is plugged into the plot, used to establish her existence, and dropped. If she had been more involved, that might have been an improvement  or might have shown up the plot's shaky contrivance. Better to devote more screen time to the lap dancer, right? Moral of the story: If you occupy the demographic that this film is aimed at, Hollywood doesn't have a very high opinion of you.</p>",

Now, as I deserve, I get \"300,\" based on another work by Miller. Of the earlier film, I wrote prophetically: \"This isn't an adaptation of a comic book, it's like a comic book brought to life and pumped with steroids.\" They must have been buying steroids wholesale for \"300.\" Every single male character, including the hunchback, has the muscles of a finalist for Mr. Universe.</span><br></p>\r<p>Both films are faithful to Miller's plots and drawings. \"300,\" I learn, reflects the book almost panel-by-panel. They lean so heavily on CGI that many shots are entirely computer-created. Why did I like the first, and dislike the second? Perhaps because of the subject matter, always a good place to start. \"Sin City,\" directed by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/robert-rodriguez\">Robert Rodriguez</a> and Miller, is film noir, my favorite genre, taken to the extreme. \"300,\" directed by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/zack-snyder\">Zack Snyder</a>, is ancient carnage, my least favorite genre, taken beyond the extreme. \"Sin City\" has vividly- conceived characters and stylized dialogue. \"300\" has one-dimensional caricatures who talk like professional wrestlers plugging their next feud.</p>\r<p>The movie involves a legendary last stand by 300 death-obsessed Spartans against a teeming horde of Persians. So brave and strong are the Spartans that they skewer, eviscerate, behead and otherwise inconvenience tens of thousands of Persians before finally falling to the weight of overwhelming numbers. The lesson is that the Spartans are free, and the Persians are slaves, although the Spartan idea of freedom is not appetizing (children are beaten to toughen them).</p>\r<p>But to return to those muscles. Although real actors play the characters and their faces are convincing, I believe their bodies are almost entirely digital creations. They have Schwarzeneggerian biceps, and every last one of them, even the greybeards, wear well-defined six- packs on their abs. I can almost believe the star, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/gerard-butler\">Gerard Butler</a>, may have been working out at Gold's Gym ever since he starred as the undernourished Phantom of the Opera, but not 300, 200 or even 100 extras. As a result, every single time I regarded the Spartans in a group, I realized I was seeing artistic renderings, not human beings. </p>\r<p>Well, maybe that was the idea.</p>\r<p>The movie presents other scenes of impossibility. Look at the long- shots of the massed Persians. There are so many they would have presented a logistical nightmare: How to feed and water them? Consider the slave-borne chariot that Xerxes pulls up in. It is larger that the imperial throne in the Forbidden City, with a wide staircase leading up to Xerxes. Impressive, but how could such a monstrosity be lugged all the way from Persia to Greece? I am not expected to apply such logic, I know, but the movie flaunts its preposterous effects.</p>\r<p>And what about Xerxes (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/rodrigo-santoro\">Rodrigo Santoro</a>) himself? He stands around eight feet tall, I guess, which is good for 500 B.C. (Santoro's height in life: 6 feet, 2.75 inches). He towers over Leonidas (Butler), so we know his body isn't really there. But what of his face? I am just about prepared to believe that the ancient Persians went in for the piercing of ears, cheeks, eyebrows, noses, lips and chins. But his eyebrow have been plucked and re-drawn into black arches that would make Joan Crawford envious. And what about the mascara and the cute little white lines on the eyelids? When the Spartans describe the Athenians as \"philosophers and boy-lovers,\" I wish they had gone right ahead to discuss the Persians.</p>\r<p>The Spartans travel light. They come bare-chested, dressed in sandals, bikini briefs and capes. They carry swords and shields. At the right time, they produce helmets which must have been concealed in their loincloths. Also apples. And from the looks of them, protein shakes. They are very athletic, able to construct a towering wall of thousands of dead Persians in hours, even after going to all the trouble of butchering them. When they go into battle, their pep talks sound like the screams of drunken sports fans swarming onto the field.</p>\r<p>They talk, as I suggested, like pro wrestlers, touting the big showdown between Edge and The Undertaker. \"Be afraid!\" they rumble, stopping just short of adding, \"Be <i> very </i> afraid.\" They talk about going on the \"warpath,\" unaware that the phrase had not yet been coined by American Indians. Their women, like Gorgo (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/lena-headey\">Lena Headey</a>), queen of Leonidas, are as bloodthirsty as their men, just like wrestler's wives.</p>\r<p>All true enough. But my deepest objection to the movie is that it is so blood-soaked. When dialogue arrives to interrupt the carnage, it's like the seventh-inning stretch. In slow motion, blood and body parts spraying through the air, the movie shows dozens, hundreds, maybe thousands, of horrible deaths. This can get depressing.</p>\r<p>In old movies, ancient Greeks were usually sort of noble. Now they have become lager louts. They celebrate a fascist ideal. They assume a bloodthirsty audience, or one suffering from attention deficit (how many disembowelings do you have to see to get the idea?). They have no grace and wisdom in their speech. Nor dignity in their bearing: They strut with arrogant pride. They are a nasty bunch. As <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/joe-mantegna\">Joe Mantegna</a> says in \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-house-of-games-1987\">House of Games</a>,\" \"You're a bad pony, and I'm not gonna bet on you.\" That's right before he dies, of course.</p>\r",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>Here's a movie without an ounce of human kindness, a sour and mean-spirited enterprise so desperate to please, it tries to be a yukky comedy and a hard-boiled action picture at the same time. It's about a gang that robs a casino while masquerading as Elvis impersonators. I was nostalgic for the recent \"Sugar and Spice,\" in which cheerleaders rob a bank while masquerading as five pregnant Betty dolls (plus one Richard Nixon).</p><p>The movie has a heavy-duty cast, with top billing shared by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/kurt-russell\">Kurt Russell</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/kevin-costner\">Kevin Costner</a>. Russell once played Elvis, very well, on TV, and hits some of the right verbal notes here. Costner, the leader of the gang, chain-smokes and looks mean. His fellow criminals include <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/christian-slater\">Christian Slater</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/david-arquette\">David Arquette</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/bokeem-woodbine\">Bokeem Woodbine</a>, who is the black guy and therefore the first to die, adhering to an ancient cliche this movie lacks the wit to rewrite.</p><p>The casino robbery involves a gory bloodbath, all gratuitous, all intercut with an Elvis revue on one of the show stages. Not intercut a little, but a lot, complete with dancing girls, until we see so much of the revue we prefer it to the shooting. (Looks like dozens of patrons are killed, but the movie of course forgets this carnage the minute it's over.) The gang makes off with the loot, there is the inevitable squabble over how to divvy it up, and then the movie's most intriguing and inexplicable relationship develops.</p><p>This is between Kurt Russell and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/courteney-cox\">Courteney Cox</a>, who plays the mom of a bright young kid (David Kaye), and is stranded in the Last Chance Motel, one of those movie sets from a Road Runner cartoon.</p><p>Cox's character is intriguing because we never understand her motivation, and inexplicable because she doesn't, either. She really does like Russell, I guess, and that explains why they're in the sack so quickly, but then the kid, who is about 8, creeps into the bedroom and steals Russell's wallet. The movie never questions the wisdom of showing the kid in the room while his mother is in bed with a stranger. One imagines that the filmmakers were so tickled by the plot point that the moral questions just didn't occur to them.</p><p>At a point later in the movie, the Cox character drives off in a car containing most of Russell's loot, while leaving her son behind with him. Would a mother do this? Some would, but most movies wouldn't consider them heroines. There is an \"explanation\" for her behavior, based on the fact that Russell, a criminal she has known for about 10 minutes, is obviously a good guy and likes the guy--but, come on.</p><p>The plot is standard double-reverse, post-\"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/reservoir-dogs-1992\">Reservoir Dogs</a>\" irony, done with a lot of style and a minimum of thought. It's about behavior patterns, not personalities. Everybody is defined by what they do. Or what they drive: As the film opens, Russell is in a 1957 red Cadillac, and Costner drives a Continental convertible of similar vintage, perhaps because they want to look like Elvis impersonators, more likely because all characters in movies like this drive 1950s cars because modern ones are too small and wimpy.</p><p>The cast stays top drawer right down to the supporting roles. <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/kevin-pollak\">Kevin Pollak</a> turns up as a federal marshal, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jon-lovitz\">Jon Lovitz</a> is a money launderer, Ice T is hired muscle. You guess they all liked the script. But the Russell and Costner characters are so burdened by the baggage of their roles that sometimes they just seem weary, and the energy mostly comes from Cox--and from the kid, who seems to be smarter than anyone else in the film, and about as experienced.</p><p>I will give \"3000 Miles to Graceland\" credit for one thing, a terrific trailer. When a bad movie produces a great trailer, it's usually evidence that the raw materials were there for a good movie. I can imagine a blood-soaked caper movie involving Elvis disguises, a lonely tramp and her bright-eyed son, but it isn't this one.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\">Here is a movie about four people who have known one another for a long time, and how their relationships shift in a way that was slow in the preparation. The film makes us care for them, and so our attention is held. I've seen films where superheroes shift alliances, and I only yawned. What matters is not the scope of a story, it's the depth.</span><br></p><p>Part of the pleasure in Claire Denis' \"35 Shots of Rum\" is working out how these people are involved with the others. Two couples live across a hallway from each other in the same Paris apartment building. Neither couple is \"together.\" Gabrielle and Noe have the vibes of roommates, but the way Lionel and Josephine obviously love each other, it's a small shock when she calls him \"Papa.\" </p><p>Lionel (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/alex-descas\">Alex Descas</a>) is a French train engineer. Josephine (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/mati-diop\">Mati Diop</a>) works in a music store. Gabrielle (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/nicole-dogue\">Nicole Dogue</a>) drives her own taxi. Noe (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/gregoire-colin\">Gregoire Colin</a>) is of uncertain plans. He claims only his much-loved cat is preventing him from moving to Brazil. The four people are in and out of both apartments that we sense they're a virtual family. Small events take place. A guy flirts with Jo at her store. Gabrielle deals with a talkative customer. Lionel and Jo both bring home rice cookers, so Jo puts hers aside so as not to hurt his feelings. </p><p>At work, Lionel attends a retirement party for a longtime engineer, Rene. His fellow workers love him, but Rene is miserable. He has no desire to retire. Afterward on a bus, he confesses to Lionel that he has no idea how he got into his life to begin with. He has no desire to be an engineer. Spending his life on trains and buses is no way to live. </p><p>Lionel seems content. All four of the neighbors seem content, yes, but not complete. One night they head out together in Gabrielle's taxi to attend a concert. The taxi breaks down, they get out of the rain and enter a Jamaican cafe; there's good music on the jukebox, they dance with one another, as well as the woman who owns the cafe, and others.</p><p>And in that long scene with its familiar music, co-writer and director Denis achieves the shift. She does it not with dialogue, not with plot points, but with the eyes. This is what movies are for. They begin happy enough, but incomplete. During the dancing and kidding around, it becomes clear to them, and to us, what must happen for the parts to fall into place.</p><p>Denis has long been interested in the former French colonies of West Africa, and in those who came from there to France. Lionel did and married a German woman; she has died, but they go to visit her sister, Jo's aunt (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/ingrid-caven\">Ingrid Caven</a>). It is part of Lionel's desire to raise his daughter well and launch her into life. Lionel is handsome, Jo is beautiful, but neither one cares about such matters.</p><p>Dogue glows in a quiet way as Gabrielle, in her 40s, once no doubt stunning, now beautiful in a comfortable way. It's clear she has long been in love with Lionel. No pressure. It's clear Lionel has put that side of his life on hold to be a good father. What does he think about his job? It is a job, he's good at it. The tragedy of the retired Rene will not be his.</p><p>You can live in a movie like this. It doesn't lecture you. These people are getting on with their lives, and Denis observes them with tact. She's not intruding, she's discovering. We sense there's not a conventional plot, and that frees us from our interior movie-going clock. We flow with them. Two are blessed, two are problematic. Will all four be blessed at the end? \"35 Shots of Rum\" is a wise movie, and knows that remains to be seen.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p><a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/catherine-breillat\">Catherine Breillat</a>s 36 Fillette follows a few crucial days in the life of Lili, a 14-year-old French girl whose body is ripe and whose soul is troubled by an unhappy home life. One night during a miserable family vacation at a tacky resort, she talks her older brother into taking her to a disco and there she begins a series of risky flirtations with older men.</p>\r<p>The first man she encounters fancies himself to be a playboy, but he is in fact a middle-age salesman who is still locked into his adolescent dream of picking up girls in his convertible. After he picks up Lili, he finds he is in for more than he bargained for. She is not a victim but a tough little cookie who tantalizes him all night long, until finally he gives up, protesting that at his age he simply lacks the stamina for an extended chase. When I first saw him I was prepared to scorn him as an irresponsible adult taking advantage of an inexperienced girl, but by this point in the evening I could see the rueful humor in his situation.</p>\r<p>Drifting on through the dreary resort where she finds herself, Lili (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/delphine-zentout\">Delphine Zentout</a>) encounters a man who is said to be a famous French personality of some sort - and indeed he is played by a famous actor, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jean-pierre-leaud\">Jean-Pierre Leaud</a>, who long ago in Truffauts <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-400-blows-1959\">The 400 Blows</a> (1959) portrayed the same kind of angry, alienated adolescent who now confronts him. He listens to her intently, looks at her quizzically and gives her some weary advice. No doubt his advice is correct, but she is too young to understand it and must make her own mistakes.</p>\r<p>The next day is another day of unhappiness with her parents, who mostly seem to drink, sleep and fight. She is alienated and isolated, and she decides it is miserable to be a virgin, so she sets out to flirt with danger, not quite knowing what she is looking for or if she really wants it. She dresses boldly and goes out to hitchhike into town and again crosses paths with the tired, alcoholic playboy (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/etienne-chicot\">Etienne Chicot</a>). He leads an exhausted night life in gloomy discos, and decides he doesnt want to have anything to do with her because she is underage. But she taunts him with her flamboyant dress and voluptuous body, and then dances away when he begins to respond.</p>\r<p>Eventually they fall into some kind of tacit friendship, based on a mutual desperation they recognize in each other.</p>\r<p>At first we are prepared to blame the man for taking advantage of a vulnerable teenager. But that is not the subject of this particular film, which Breillat says is somewhat autobiographical. 36 Fillette (the title is a French bra size) is a film told from Lilis point of view, and the middle-age man is almost a prop; at this moment in her life, any man would have done, since she is not sure what shes looking for, anyway.</p>\r<p>We have caught her at a moment when her unhappiness has coincided with her sudden discovery of her sexuality and the power she can have over men. With a boldness born of anger and naivete, heedless of danger, she sets out to manipulate this man. Her psychological motivations are hinted at in a scene where her father is uncaring, but this is a film of observation, not analysis.</p>\r<p>The key scene in the film is a long, meticulously observed emotional fencing match in the mans hotel room, during which they both sense, perhaps, that despite the gulf between them they share the same loneliness and unhappiness with themselves. This is a great scene, and its whole delicate existence depends on the performance by Zentout, a 16-year-old in her acting debut. She gives a brave and convincing performance.</p>\r<p>The movie is controversial because of the difference in age between the two lovers, and because of the girls blatant, if naive, sexuality. But Breillat has made a film far more complex than it might seem. This film depicts the sort of situation one should deplore, but the film is so specifically about two particular people that it slips away from convention and just quietly goes its own way.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>\"I just hope I live to fulfill all my dreams,\" Ankilewitz says. So do we all, and we don't want to die then, either. We want to sit around for years having fulfilled them. The documentary \"39 Pounds of Love\" informs us that Ami's dreams are three: To win the love of his caretaker Christina, to visit America for a reunion with his brother, and to find that doctor and tell him he was wrong.</p><p>Christina is a pretty Romanian, about 21 years old, who lifts Ami out of his bath with frightening ease. \"She is beautiful, young, alive,\" Ami says, using a Madonna-style microphone to amplify his fragile voice. \"There is nothing in this world I want more than to be with her.\" Christina says she loves him, \"but it is not the love of two lovers.\" Ami requires more love than that, and sends her away: \"I can't go on like this. Just tell her to go out of the house.\" She leaves.</p><p>Ami now plans his trip to America, against the urgent advice of his mother, Helene, who argues he is not strong enough to survive the trip. Ami insists on going, and enlists his best friend and former caretaker Asaf to accompany him, along with <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/dani-menkin\">Dani Menkin</a>, the director of this film, and no doubt various crew members not seen.</p><p>They rent a van and return to his Texas birthplace for a reunion with the brother. In Santa Fe, he visits a church where miracles are said to take place, but none do, or seem about to, or seem to have occurred in the past. A motorcycle club gives him his chance to ride a Harley at last; he is placed in a sidecar, and there is a shot of the wind in his hair and a smile on his face. At the Grand Canyon, Ami passes out and is rushed away in an ambulance. Eventually he finds the elderly and perplexed Dr. Albert Cordova, who listens as Ami explains that he was the child who would die before he was 6, that he is 34 and did not die, and that the doctor should not presume such confidence about the future. The doctor never says a word during this speech, but then gets his own closeup in which he solemnly congratulates Ami on his longevity and wishes him good health.</p><p>These are the materials for a touching documentary, but that's what they feel like: The materials, so arranged as to suggest questions that undermine the effect of the film. We know that in most documentaries some casual rearrangement of reality takes place, and events happen at least in part because the camera is there to witness them. But \"39 Pounds of Love\" feels uncomfortably stage-managed, and raises fundamental questions that it simply ignores.</p><p>When Ami protests his love for Christina, and she replies, and he sends her away, there is the distinct sensation that all of three events were predetermined before they happened in front of the camera. \"When was the first time you realized you were completely different?\" he is asked, and replies, \"When Christina walked out the door.\" Really? He realized it as late as the events in this film? There's an indefinable scent of reality <i>actually happening right now</i> in most documentaries. In this one, we feel that Ami knows Christina will leave before he says he loves her, and that she has already left before we see her leave.</p><p>Then the best friend and former caretaker arrives to support the trip to America. But is Asaf along merely as best friend, or has he been hired again as caretaker, to make the film possible? It is suggested that the brother has been estranged from the family (there is another brother, never seen, and the Mexican mother's Israeli ex-husband, never dealt with). But when the brother emerges from his American house, it is for a joyous reunion. Was the estrangement settled offscreen? What was its cause? Had it never before occurred to anyone in Israel that Ami could ride in a Harley sidecar?</p><p>As for poor Dr. Cordova, he seems startled by his role, and there is some question in the film itself about whether this is one and the same man who made the dire prediction about Ami.</p><p>Those are questions involving what we see. More perplexing are questions about what we don't see. After Ami collapses and is taken away by ambulance, what happened then? How much time passed before the visit to Cordova? What risks were involved? Was the American visit cut short? The film itself is certainly cut short; it ends after 70 minutes, without any scenes of Ami returning home and without any feeling of closure; it simply stops and the credits begin, at a point when everything we know about storytelling suggests there should be scenes of closure.</p><p>How is Ami today? What are his thoughts about his journey? Isn't it ominous that there are no homecoming scenes? Were they not filmed, or were they not happy? \"The trip is not going to end well,\" a friend predicts before it begins. Any experienced documentarian watching this film would be keeping a mental inventory of the missing scenes, realizing that without them, as the saying goes, \"we don't have a movie.\"</p><p>None of this is intended to detract from the courage and will of Ami Ankilewitz. His life is extraordinary. But he has not been well served by the documentarians. Having been assigned by fate to an undeveloped body, he is the victim for reasons unknown of an undeveloped film. That \"39 Pounds of Love\" was short-listed as an Oscar contender suggests that the short-listers were not knowledgeable about documentaries, or that they were honoring Ami and not his film. That this film but not Werner Herzog's \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/grizzly-man-2005\">Grizzly Man</a>\" made the cut reflects bad judgment bordering on scandal.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"><a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/james-mangold\">James Mangold</a>'s \"3:10 to Yuma\" restores the wounded heart of the Western and rescues it from the morass of pointless violence. The Western in its glory days was often a morality play, a story about humanist values penetrating the lawless anarchy of the frontier. It still follows that tradition in films like Eastwood's \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-unforgiven-1992\">Unforgiven</a>,\" but the audience's appetite for morality plays and Westerns seems to be fading. Here the quality of the acting, and the thought behind the film, make it seem like a vanguard of something new, even though it's a remake of a good movie 50 years old.</span><br></p><p>The plot is so easily told that <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/elmore-leonard\">Elmore Leonard</a> originally wrote it as a short story. A man named Dan Evans (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/christian-bale\">Christian Bale</a>), who lost a leg in the Civil War, has come to the Arizona territory to try his luck at ranching. It's going badly, made worse by a neighboring bully who wants to force him off his land. The territory still fears Indian raids, and just as much the lawless gang led by Ben Wade (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/russell-crowe\">Russell Crowe</a>), which sticks up stagecoaches, robs banks, casually murders people and outguns any opposition. Through a series of developments that seem almost dictated by fate, Dan Evans finds himself as part of a posse sworn in to escort Wade, captured and handcuffed, to the nearby town of Contention, where the 3:10 p.m. train has a cell in its mail car that will transport Wade to the prison in Yuma and a certain death sentence.</p><p>Both Dan and Ben have elements in their characters that come under test in this adventure. Dan fears he has lost the confidence of wife Alice (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/gretchen-mol\">Gretchen Mol</a>) and teenage son Will (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/logan-lerman\">Logan Lerman</a>), who doubt he can make the ranch work. Still less does Alice see why her transplanted Eastern husband should risk his life as a volunteer. The son Will, who has practically memorized dime novels about Ben Wade, idealizes the outlaw, and when Dan realizes the boy has followed the posse, he is not pleased. Wade intuits, however, that the boy is following him, and not his father.</p><p>That's an insight into Wade. He plays his persona like a performance. He draws, reads, philosophizes, is incomparably smarter than the scum in his gang. Having spent untold time living on the run with them, he may actually find it refreshing to spend time with Dan, even as his captive. Eventually the two men end up in a room in the Contention hotel, overlooking the street, in earshot of the train whistle, surrounded outside by armed men who want to rescue Ben or kill him.</p><p>These general outlines also describe the 1957 version of \"3:10 to Yuma,\" directed by Delmer Daves, starring <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/glenn-ford\">Glenn Ford</a> and Van Heflin in the roles of the rancher and the outlaw. The movie, with its railroad timetable, followed the slowly advancing clock in \"High Noon\" (1952) and was compared to it; when I saw it in 35mm at Telluride in the 1980s, I thought it was better than \"High Noon,\" not least because of the personality shifts it involves.</p><p>Mangold's version is better still than the 1957 original, because it has better actors with more thought behind their dialogue. Christian Bale plays not simply a noble hero, but a man who has avoided such risks as he now takes and is almost at a loss to explain why he is bringing a killer to justice, except that having been mistreated and feeling unable to provide for his family, he is fed up and here he takes his stand. Crowe, however, plays not merely a merciless killer, although he is that, too, but a man also capable of surprising himself. He is too intelligent to have only one standard behavior which must fit all situations, and is perhaps bored of having that expected of him.</p><p>Westerns used to be the showcases of great character actors, of whom I was lucky enough to meet <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/dub-taylor\">Dub Taylor</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jack-elam\">Jack Elam</a>, Chill Wills, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/ben-johnson\">Ben Johnson</a> and, when she wasn't doing a million other things, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/shelley-winters\">Shelley Winters</a>. \"3:10 to Yuma\" has two roles that need a special character flavor and fills them perfectly. <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/peter-fonda\">Peter Fonda</a> plays McElroy, a professional bounty hunter who would rather claim the price on Ben Wade's head than let the government execute him for free. And <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/ben-foster\">Ben Foster</a> plays Charlie Prince, the second-in-command of Wade's gang, who seems half in love with Wade, or maybe Charlie's half-aware that's he's all in love. Wade would know which, and wouldn't care, except as material for his study of human nature.</p><p>Locked in the hotel room, surrounded by death for one or the other, the two men begin to talk. Without revealing anything of the plot, let me speculate that each senses he has found the first man he has met in years who is his equal in conversation. Crowe and Bale play this dialogue so precisely that it never reveals itself for what it really is, a testing of mutual insight. One trial of a great actor is the ability to let dialogue do its work invisibly, something you can also see in next week's \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/in-the-valley-of-elah-2007\">In the Valley of Elah</a>\" with <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/tommy-lee-jones\">Tommy Lee Jones</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/charlize-theron\">Charlize Theron</a>. Too many actors are like the guy who laughs at his own joke and then tells it to you again.</p><p>James Mangold first came into view with an extraordinary movie named \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/heavy-1996\">Heavy</a>\" (1995). His \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/walk-the-line-2005\">Walk the Line</a>\" (2005) won an Oscar for <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/reese-witherspoon\">Reese Witherspoon</a>. To remake \"3:10 to Yuma\" seems an odd choice after such other modern films as \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/girl-interrupted-2000\">Girl, Interrupted</a>,\" but the movie itself proves he had a good reason for choosing it. In hard times, Americans have often turned to the Western to reset their compasses. In very hard times, it takes a very good Western. Attend well to Ben Wade's last words in this movie, and who he says them to, and why.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p></p><p>The little girls had gone to church early for choir practice,\rand we can imagine them, dressed in their Sunday best, meeting their friends in\rthe room destroyed by the bomb. We can fashion the picture in our minds because\rLee has, in a way, brought them back to life, through photographs, through old\rhome movies and especially through the memories of their families and friends.</p><p>By coincidence, I was listening to the radio not long after\rseeing 4 Little Girls, and I heard a report from Charlayne Hunter-Gault. In\r1961, when she was 19, she was the first black woman to desegregate the\rUniversity of Georgia. Today she is an NPR correspondent. That is what happened\rto her. In 1963, Carole Robertson was 14, and her Girl Scout sash was covered\rwith merit badges. Because she was killed that day, we will never know what\rwould have happened in her life.</p><p>That thought keeps returning: The four little girls never got to\rgrow up. Not only were their lives stolen, but so were their contributions to\rours. I have a hunch that Denise McNair, who was 11 when she died, would have\rmade her mark. In home movies, she comes across as poised and observant, filled\rwith charisma. Among the many participants in the film, two of the most\rstriking are her parents, Chris and Maxine McNair, who remember a special\rchild.</p><p>Chris McNair talks of a day when he took Denise to downtown\rBirmingham, and the smell of onions frying at a store's lunch counter made her\rhungry. That night I knew I had to tell her she couldn't have that sandwich\rbecause she was black, he recalls. That couldn't have been any less painful\rthan seeing her with a rock smashed into her head. Lee's film re-creates the\rday of the bombing through newsreel footage, photographs and eyewitness\rreports. He places it within a larger context of the Southern civil rights\rmovement, and sit-ins and the arrests, the marches, the songs and the killings.</p><p>Birmingham was a tough case. Police commissioner Bull Connor is\rseen directing the resistance to marchers and traveling in an armored\rvehicle--painted white, of course. Gov. <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/george-wallace\">George Wallace</a> makes his famous vow to\rstand in the schoolhouse door and personally bar any black students from\rentering. Though they could not know it, their resistance was futile after\rSept. 15, 1963, because the hatred exposed by the bomb pulled all of their\rrhetoric and rationalizations out from under them.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/spike-lee\">Spike Lee</a> says he has wanted to make this film since 1983, when\rhe read a New York Times Magazine article by Howell Raines about the bombing. He\rwrote me asking permission back then, Chris McNair told me in an interview. That\rwas before he had made any of his films. It is perhaps good that Lee waited,\rbecause he is more of a filmmaker now, and events have supplied him a\rdenouement in the conviction of a man named Robert Chambliss (Dynamite Bob)\ras the bomber. He was, said Raines, who met quite a few, the most pathological\rracist I've ever encountered. The other victims were Addie Mae Collins and\rCynthia Wesley, both 14. In shots that are almost unbearable, we see the\rvictims' bodies in the morgue. Why does Lee show them? To look full into the\rface of what was done, I think. To show racism its handiwork. There is a memory\rin the film of a burly white Birmingham policeman who after the bombing tells a\rblack minister, I really didn't believe they would go this far. The man was a\rKlansman, the movie says, but in using the word they he unconsciously\rseparates himself from his fellows. He wants to disassociate himself from the\rcrime. So did others. Before long even Wallace was apologizing for his behavior\rand trying to define himself in a different light. There is a scene in the film\rwhere the former governor, now old and infirm, describes his black personal\rassistant, Eddie Holcey, as his best friend. I couldn't live without him,\rWallace says, dragging Holcey in front of the camera, insensitive to the\rfeelings of the man he is tugging over for display.</p><p>Why is that scene there? It's sort of associated with the morgue\rphotos, I think. There is mostly sadness and regret at the surface in 4 Little\rGirls, but there is anger in the depths, as there should be.</p><p></p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\">Gabita is perhaps the most clueless young woman ever to have the lead in a movie about her own pregnancy. Even if you think \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/juno-2007\">Juno</a>\" was way too clever, two hours with Gabita will have you buying a ticket to Bucharest for <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/diablo-cody\">Diablo Cody</a>. This is a powerful film and a stark visual accomplishment, but no thanks to Gabita (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/laura-vasiliu\">Laura Vasiliu</a>). The driving character is her roommate Otilia (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/anamaria-marinca\">Anamaria Marinca</a>), who does all the heavy lifting.</span></p>\r<p>The time is the late 1980s. Romania still cringes under the brainless rule of Ceausescu. In Cristian Mungiu's \"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days,\" Gabita desires an abortion, which was then illegal, not for moral reasons, but because Ceausescu wanted more subjects to rule. She turns in desperation to her roommate Otilia, who agrees to help her, and does. Helps her so much, indeed, she does everything but have the abortion herself. In a period of 24 hours, we follow the two friends in a journey of frustration, stupidity, duplicity, cruelty and desperation, set against a background of a nation where if it weren't for the black market, there'd be no market at all.</p>\r<p>For Gabita, the notion of taking responsibility for her own actions is completely unfamiliar. We wonder how she has survived to her current 20-ish age in a society that obviously requires boldness, courage and improvisation. For starters, she persuades Otilia to raise money for the operation. Then she asks her to go first to meet the abortionist. Then she neglects to make a reservation at the hotel that the abortionist specifies. That almost sinks the arrangement: The abortionist has experience suggesting that hotel will be a safe venue, and suspects he may be set up for a police trap. His name, by the way, is Mr. Bebe (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/vlad-ivanov\">Vlad Ivanov</a>), and no, \"bebe\" is apparently not Romanian for \"baby,\" but it looks suspicious to me.</p>\r<p>The movie deliberately levels an unblinking gaze at its subjects. There are no fancy shots, no effects, no quick cuts, and Mungiu and his cinematographer, Oleg Mutu, adhere to a rule of one shot per scene. That makes camera placement and movement crucial, and suggests that every shot has been carefully prepared. Even shots where the ostensible subject of the action is half-visible, or not seen at all, serve a purpose, by insisting on the context and the frame. Visuals are everything here; the film has no music, only words or silences.</p>\r<p>Otilia is heroic in this context; she reminds me a little of the ambulance attendant in the 2005 Romanian film \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-death-of-mr-lazarescu-2006\">The Death of Mr. Lazarescu</a>,\" who drove a dying man around all night, insisting on a hospital for him. Otilia grows exasperated with her selfish and self-obsessed friend, but she keeps on trying to help, even though she has problems of her own.</p>\r<p>One of them is her boyfriend Adi (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/alex-potocean\">Alex Potocean</a>), who is himself so self-oriented that we wonder if Otilia is attracted to the type. Even though she tries to explain that she and Gabita have urgent personal business, he insists on Otilia coming to his house to meet his family that night. He turns it into a test of her love. People who do that are incapable of understanding that to compromise would be a proof of their own love.</p>\r<p>The dinner party she arrives at would be a horror show even in a <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/mike-leigh\">Mike Leigh</a> display of social embarrassment. She's jammed at a table with too many guests, too much smoking, too much drinking, and no one who pays her the slightest attention, and as the unmoving camera watches her, we wait for her to put a fork in somebody's eye. When she gets away to make a phone call, Adi follows her and drags her into his room, and then Adi's mother bursts in on them and we see from whom Adi learned his possessiveness</p>\r<p>When the friends finally find themselves in a hotel room with the abortionist, the result is as unpleasant, heartless and merciless as it could possibly be. I'll let you discover for yourself. And finally there is a closing scene where Otilia and Gabita agree to never refer to this night again. Some critics have found the scene anticlimactic. I think it is inevitable. If I were Otilia, I would never even see Gabita again. I'd send over Adi to collect my clothes.</p>\r<p>Filmmakers in countries of the former Soviet bloc have been using their new freedom to tell at last the stories they couldn't tell then. \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-lives-of-others-2007-1\">The Lives of Others</a>,\" for example, was about the East German secret police. And in Romania, the era has inspired a group of powerful films, including \"Mr. Lazarescu\" and \"12:08 East of Bucharest\" (2006) and \"4 Months,\" which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes 2007, upsetting a lot of American critics who admired it but liked \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/no-country-for-old-men-2007\">No Country for Old Men</a>\" more.</p>\r<p>The film has inspired many words about how it reflects Romanian society, but obtaining an illegal abortion was much the same in this country until some years ago, and also in Britain, as we saw in Leigh's \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/vera-drake-2004\">Vera Drake</a>.\" The fascination of the film comes not so much from the experiences the friends have, however unspeakable, but in who they are, and how they behave and relate. Anamaria Marinca gives a masterful performance as Otilia, but don't let my description of Gabita blind you to the brilliance of Laura Vasiliu's acting. These are two of the more plausible characters I've seen in a while.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p><a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/liv-ullmann\">Liv Ullmann</a>'s car breaks down in Greece, and she is on the point of total frustration when a young American pulls up on his motor scooter. He offers her a ride into town. She cannot take it; she is too old, she says, to be dashing around on motor scooters. She is, after all, 36. The youth's eyes light up, as whose would not when confronted by Liv Ullmann, and he launches a seduction attempt that begins with a shot of ouzo and ends with love on the beach.</p>\r<p>But Liv slips away in the dawn, and the two lovers don't meet until months later, in New York, when he shows up as her daughter's date. Electricity fills the air. The daughter is abandoned to her pool game, which is pretty good. Love blooms. But there's still this problem. He's 22, and she's 36 . . . well, 38 . . . 40, actually. \"Forty Carats,\" a movie made from a Broadway play which, in turn, was adapted from a French play (can we expect the stage musical soon?), attacks this problem with a great deal of romantic zeal. But it's a little hard to care. We don't really mind whether she's 40 and he's 22; what we care about is what they're like, and whether as fictional characters they can hold our interest. They don't, alas, and so the movie bogs down in the sort of theoretical dialog George Bernard Shaw would have written had he lacked wit.</p>\r<p>In trying to figure out why I was personally unmoved by the dilemma in the movie, I finally arrived at Liv Ullmann. It is simply not possible to accept her as a conservative 40 year-old woman, uncertain of her attractiveness and shy about accepting love. That isn't the Liv Ullmann we know. The things that are said about her character in \"Forty Carats\" simply don't apply to the person we see, who is radiant, beautiful and supremely sure of herself.</p>\r<p>The question I was left with after the movie was an opposite one: How could such a beautiful woman ever fall for a chump like the kid? The 22 year-old is played by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/edward-albert\">Edward Albert</a>, recently seen in \"Butterflies Are Free.\" He's sort of wooden and a little too handsome, and he doesn't seem to love her, he seems to want to reason with her. It's as if he can bring her around with pure logic. That may theoretically be possible, but it's less fun than the other ways.</p>\r<p>The movie adaptation makes a couple of departures from the stage play that may be mistakes. The confrontation between Liv Ullmann and the young man's parents, for example, is played very heavily and with undercurrents of cruelty on the part of the father. He seems, indeed, like a sort of reverse version of the father played by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/eddie-albert\">Eddie Albert</a> in \"The Heartbreak Kid\": a man working out his own problems through the lives of his wife and son. The scene is too real and harsh to be supported by a comedy.</p>\r<p>But a comedy it is, and that contributes the other difference between play and movie: This one has a happier ending. In the play, the lovers finally do separate. In the movie they meet again, on that very same beach in Greece (needless to say), and we fade out on the prospect of love having conquered reason, or something. The story would have been a lot more interesting had it begun with the wedding and covered the first six months of married life Especially it Fred and Ethel Mertz were living next door.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>Matt is weary of sex. Weary of himself as a sex partner. Weary of the way he behaves around women, weary of the way women make him behave, and weary of his treacherous ex-girl. So weary that he swears off sex for Lent in \"40 Days and 40 Nights.\" On the scale of single guy sacrifice, this is harder than not drinking but easier than asking directions.</p><p>Matt (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/josh-hartnett\">Josh Hartnett</a>) is a nice guy who is disgusted by his predatory sexual nature--at the way his libido goes on autopilot when he sees an attractive woman. The breakup with Nicole (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/vinessa-shaw\">Vinessa Shaw</a>) is the final straw. She loved him, dumped him, still excites him, and no wonder; as Bagel Man, who makes morning deliveries to the office, observes, \"She's so hot you need one of those cardboard eclipse things just to look at her.\" Matt gets some support from his brother John (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/adam-trese\">Adam Trese</a>), who is studying to be a priest and offers advice which is more practical than theologically sound, but nobody else in Matt's life believes he can go 40 days without sex. Certainly not a co-worker (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/monet-mazur\">Monet Mazur</a>), who gives him her phone number on a Xerox of her butt.</p><p>Then Matt meets Laundromat Girl. She is sweet, pretty, smart and something clicks. He tries to keep his distance and end the conversation before his dreaded instincts click in, but a week later he's back in the Laundromat and so is she. Her name is Erica (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/shannyn-sossamon\">Shannyn Sossamon</a>), and soon they are engaged in a courtship that proceeds, from her point of view, rather strangely. On their first real date, when the moment comes for their first kiss, they grow closer and quieter and then he gives her a high-five. What's up with this guy? \"40 Days and 40 Nights\" was directed by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/michael-lehmann\">Michael Lehmann</a>, who has a sympathy for his characters that elevates the story above the level of a sexual sitcom. He uses humor as an instrument to examine human nature, just as he did in the wonderful, underrated \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-truth-about-cats-and-dogs-1996\">The Truth About Cats and Dogs</a>.\" Amazing, what a gulf there is between movies about characters governed by their genitals, and this movie about a character trying to govern his genitals.</p><p>The world seems to conspire against him. The movie's single funniest scene involves dinner with his parents, where his father, who has just had a hip replacement, is delighted to show him a checklist of sexual positions still workable even while he is still wearing the cast. The second funniest scene involves a roommate who bursts into Matt's flat with an ultra violet lamp to check for telltale secretions on the sheets.</p><p>Then Matt discovers to his horror that his coworkers have not only got up an office pool on how long he can go without sex, but have put the pool on a Web site. Matt looks at the site in disbelief: \"You're selling banner ads?\" When Erica sees the site, there's hell to pay.</p><p>Hartnett shows here a breezy command of his charming, likable character. It is a reminder of his talent and versatility. After an actor stars in a movie that's widely disparaged, as Hartnett did with \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/pearl-harbor-2001\">Pearl Harbor</a>,\" there is an unfair tendency to blame the film on him. The same thing happened to <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/kevin-costner\">Kevin Costner</a> after \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-postman-1997\">The Postman</a>.\" Actors we liked fall out of favor, as if they didn't work just as hard, and hope as much, for their flops as for their hits. Walking into this movie, I heard \"Pearl Harbor\" jokes (\"40 days that will live in infamy\"), but during the screening the screenplay kicked in and the next stage of Hartnett's career was officially declared open.</p><p>\"40 Days and 40 Nights\" does observe the plot conventions of a standard comedy, requiring Erica to persist in unreasonably obtuse behavior far beyond its logical time-span, but the details are fresh and writer Rob Perez's dialogue about sex has more complexity and nuance than we expect.</p><p>And a romantic scene involving flower blossoms is unreasonably erotic. The ending, alas, goes astray, for reasons I cannot reveal, except to suggest that Nicole's entire participation is offensive and unnecessary, and that there was a sweeter and funnier way to resolve everything.</p><p>Note: Not even under the end titles does the movie use the <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/muddy-waters\">Muddy Waters</a> classic \"40 Days and 40 Nights.\" In an age when every song title seems to be recycled into a movie, what were they thinking of?</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>Here's a movie that could have had the same title and been a crude sex comedy with contempt for its characters. Instead, \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" is surprisingly insightful, as buddy comedies go, and it has a good heart and a lovable hero. It's not merely that Andy Stitzer rides his bike to work, it's that he signals his turns.</p><p>Andy (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/steve-carell\">Steve Carell</a>) is indeed 40 and a virgin, after early defeats in the gender wars turned him into a non-combatant. His strategy for dealing with life is to surround himself with obsessions, including action figures, video games, high-tech equipment, and \"collectibles,\" a word which, like \"drinkable,\" never sounds like a glowing endorsement.</p><p>Andy is one of those guys whose life is a workaround. What he doesn't understand, he avoids, finesses or fakes. On the job at the electronics superstore where he works, his fellow employees spend a lot of time talking about women, and he nods as if he speaks the language. Then they rope him into a poker game, the conversation turns to sex, and they look at him strangely when he observes enthusiastically how women's breasts feel like bags of sand.</p><p>The buddies are wonderfully cast. David (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/paul-rudd\">Paul Rudd</a>) is still hopelessly in love with a woman who has long since outgrown any possible interest in him; Jay (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/romany-malco\">Romany Malco</a>) is a ladies' man who considers himself an irresistible seducer, and Cal (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/seth-rogen\">Seth Rogen</a>) is the guy with practical guidance, such as \"date drunks\" and \"never actually say anything to a woman; just ask questions.\" All these guys have problems of their own, and seem prepared to pass them on to Andy as advice; listen with particular care to the definition of \"aftercourse.\" Also at work is Paula (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jane-lynch\">Jane Lynch</a>), Andy's boss, a tall, striking woman who is definitely not a 40-year-old virgin; after asking him if he's ever heard of just being sex buddies, she promises him, \"I'm discreet, and I'll haunt your dreams.\"</p><p>Andy would just as soon stay home and play with his action figures. But his friends consider it a sacred mission to end his 40-year drought. In a singles bar, under their coaching, he separates a tipsy babe from the crowd; his alarm should have gone off when she asks him to blow into the breathalyzer so she can start her car. In a bookstore he asks a cute sales clerk one question after another, which works charmingly until she finds out he has no answers. He goes to one of those dating round-robins where a buzzer goes off and you switch tables, giving the movie an opportunity to assemble a little anthology of pickup cliches.</p><p>And then there's Trish (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/catherine-keener\">Catherine Keener</a>). She runs a store across the mall, where you can take in your stuff and she'll sell it on eBay. Andy knows right away that he really likes her, but he's paralyzed by shyness and fear, and the way she coaxes him into asking her out is written so well it could be in a more serious movie. Or maybe it is; there's an insight and understanding under the surface of \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" that is subtle, but sincere.</p><p>On the surface, the movie assembles a collection of ethnic types as varied as \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/crash-2005\">Crash</a>.\" It has fun with them, but it likes them, and it's gentle fun that looks for humanity, not cheap laughs. Consider the character who unexpectedly performs a Guatemalan love song, or Andy's neighbors, who like to watch \"Survivor\" with him, although he has to bring the set. The movie approaches the subject of homosexuality without the usual gay-bashing, in a scene where the guys trade one-liners beginning \"I know you're gay because\" and their reasons show more insight than prejudice.</p><p>But the best reason the movie works is because Steve Carell and Catherine Keener have a rare kind of chemistry that is maybe better described as mutual sympathy. Keener is an actress at the top of her form, and to see her in \"Lovely &amp; Amazing\" and \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-ballad-of-jack-and-rose-2005\">The Ballad of Jack and Rose</a>\" and then in \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/virgin-2005\">Virgin</a>\" is to watch an actress who starts every role with a complete understanding of the woman inside. Her task in the plot is to end Andy's virginity, but her challenge is to create a relationship we care about. We do. The character Trish is intuitively understanding, but more importantly, she actually likes this guy. Keener's inspiration is to have Trish see Andy not as a challenge, but as an opportunity.</p><p>The movie was directed by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/judd-apatow\">Judd Apatow</a>, who produced \"Anchorman,\" and written by Apatow and Carell, the \"Daily Show\" veteran who first developed the idea of a closeted virgin in a Second City skit. The screenplay is filled with small but perfect one-liners (as when Andy is advised to emulate <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/david-caruso\">David Caruso</a> in \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/jade-1995\">Jade</a>\"). At the end, for no good reason except that it strikes exactly the perfect (if completely unexpected) note, the cast performs a Bollywood version of \"Age of Aquarius.\" By then, they could have done almost anything and I would have been smiling.</p>",

It happened to <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/faye-dunaway\">Faye Dunaway</a> when she looked sleepily out of a screen window at <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/warren-beatty\">Warren Beatty</a> in \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-bonnie-and-clyde-1967\">Bonnie and Clyde</a>.\" And in \"48 Hrs.,\" it happens to <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/eddie-murphy\">Eddie Murphy</a>. </p><p>His unforgettable scene comes about halfway through 48 Hrs. He plays a convict who has done thirty months for theft and still has six months to go -- but he gets a forty-eight hour prison leave through the efforts of <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/nick-nolte\">Nick Nolte</a>, a hungover hot dog of a detective who's on the trail of some cop killers and figures Murphy can help. Murphy thinks there's a bartender who may have some information. The thing is, the bar is a redneck country joint, the kind where urban cowboys drink out of longneck bottles and salute the Confederate flag on the wall. Murphy has been jiving Nolte about how he can handle any situation. Nolte gives him a chance. And Murphy, impersonating a police officer, walks into that bar, takes command, totally intimidates everybody, and gets his information. It's a great scene -- the mirror image of that scene in \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-french-connection-1971\">The French Connection</a>\" where <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/gene-hackman\">Gene Hackman</a>, as Popeye Doyle, intimidated the black regulars in a Harlem bar.</p><p>Murphy has other good moments in this movie, and so does Nolte, who gives a wonderful performance as a cynical, irresponsible, and immature cop who's always telling lies to his girlfriend and sneaking a jolt of whiskey out of his personal flask. The two men start out suspicious of each other in this movie and work up to a warm dislike. But eventually, grudgingly, a kind of respect starts to grow.</p><p>The movie's story is nothing to write home about. It's pretty routine. What makes the movie special is how it's made. Nolte and Murphy are good, and their dialogue is good, too -- quirky and funny. </p><p>Character actor <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/james-remar\">James Remar</a> makes a really slimy killer, genuinely evil. <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/annette-otoole\">Annette O&#x27;Toole</a> gets third billing as Nolte's lover, but it's another one of those thankless women's roles. Not only could O'Toole have phoned it in -- but she does, spending most of her scenes on the telephone calling Nolte a no-good bum. The direction is by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/walter-hill\">Walter Hill</a>, who has never been any good at scenes involving women and doesn't improve this time. What he is good at is action, male camaraderie and atmosphere. His movies almost always feature at least one beautifully choreographed, unbelievably violent fight scene (remember Charles Bronson's bare-knuckle fight in \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/hard-times-1975\">Hard Times</a>\"?), and the fight scene this time is exhausting.</p><p>Where Hill grows in this movie is in his ability to create characters. In a lot of his earlier movies (\"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-warriors-1979\">The Warriors</a>,\" \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-driver-1978\">The Driver</a>,\" \"The Long Riders,\" \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/southern-comfort-1981\">Southern Comfort</a>\") he preferred men who were symbols, who represented things and so didn't have to be human. In \"48 Hrs.,\" Nolte and Murphy are human, vulnerable, and touching. Also mean, violent, and chauvinistic. It's that kind of movie.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>At the end of this film there is a montage of sad people holding photographs of their grandparents, parents, husbands, wives or children, who were killed during the so-called Five Days of War between Russia and Georgia. It is unforgivable to borrow human grief and evoke it to lend weight to an action movie scarcely deeper than a <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/michael-bay\">Michael Bay</a> extravaganza. Here you will hear a great deal about the war, but learn not so very much, and all of that from the Georgian point of view. Mind you, I'm not saying its POV is wrong, only that a cheesy war thriller financed with Georgian funds seems an odd way to publicize it.</p><p>The heroes of \"5 Days of War\" are war correspondents. The film opens with the fact that 500 reporters have been killed in war over the last decade. That is a tragedy, but one must reflect that countless more soldiers and civilians have been killed during the same period, and so the focus seems a little misguided, especially since some of these reporters are less than noble. Consider Dutchman (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/val-kilmer\">Val Kilmer</a>), an enigmatic journalist apparently in search of a good time.</p><p>The main hero is Thomas Anders (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/rupert-friend\">Rupert Friend</a>), a reporter who free-lances for cable. His cameraman is Sebastian Ganz (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/richard-coyle\">Richard Coyle</a>). In a prologue set in Iraq, they're teamed with Miriam (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/heather-graham\">Heather Graham</a>), Thomas' girlfriend, who is killed  sending him back to Los Angeles (so informs the subtitle) until Dutchman, via Skype from his bathtub, gives him the joyous news: \"This place is about to blow!\" He's right, and Thomas will go through most of the movie with an open wound on his nose, perhaps fearing that a Band-Aid would remind moviegoers of <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jack-nicholson\">Jack Nicholson</a> in \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-chinatown-1974\">Chinatown</a>.\"</p><p>How, you may wonder, do actual Georgians figure in this film, except in the coda? Well, the reporters get invited to a wedding, which is attacked by Russian helicopters. Thomas has become friendly with Tatia (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/emmanuelle-chriqui\">Emmanuelle Chriqui</a>), who is to be his translator, and after many deaths at the wedding, Thomas and Sebastian end up fleeing with Tatia and family members. This consists of them running hunched over and ducking behind fences while accounting for the points of view of many unrelated action scenes.</p><p>None of the action is coherent; shots and shells are fired, people and killed or not, explosions rend the air, SUVs spin aloft (the same one more than once, I think), and there is no sense of strategy. Occasionally, we cut to the state offices of Mikheil Saakashvili, the Georgian president, who is played by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/andy-garcia\">Andy Garcia</a>, it being his misfortune to resemble Saakashvili. There are also vignettes involving a sadistic (Mikko Nousiainen) and a ruthless Russian colonel (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/rade-serbedzija\">Rade Serbedzija</a>, both of whom commit the Fallacy of the Talking Killer).</p><p><a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/renny-harlin\">Renny Harlin</a> is known for his action pictures (\"Die Hard 2,\" \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/cliffhanger-1993\">Cliffhanger</a>\") and not for his geopolitical insights. If the purpose of this film is to whip up sympathy for the Georgians, I doubt if few moviegoers not from that area will care. It's a lot of tough guys running around blowing up stuff real good, and getting so many good peeks at crucial action that we wonder why neither the Georgians or the Russians can see people hiding behind a fence where even we can see them.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>Just in time for Valentine's Day, \"50 First Dates\" is a spin on the \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-groundhog-day-1993\">Groundhog Day</a>\" notion of a day that keeps repeating itself. This time, though, the recycling takes place entirely inside the mind of Lucy Whitmore (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/drew-barrymore\">Drew Barrymore</a>), who was in an accident that caused short-term memory loss. Every night while she sleeps, the slate of her memory is wiped clean, and when she wakes up in the morning, she remembers everything that happened up to the moment of the accident, but nothing that happened afterward.</p><p>Is this possible? I'd like to bring in <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/oliver-sacks\">Oliver Sacks</a> for a second opinion. Seems to me that short-term memory loss doesn't work on a daily timetable, but is more like the affliction of \"10-Second Tom,\" a character in the movie who reboots every 10 seconds.</p><p>Still, this isn't a psychiatric docudrama but a lighthearted romantic comedy, and the premise works to provide <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/adam-sandler\">Adam Sandler</a> and Barrymore with a sweet story. They work well together, as they showed in \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-wedding-singer-1998\">The Wedding Singer</a>\"; they have the same tone of smiling, coy sincerity.</p><p>The movie is sort of an experiment for Sandler. He reveals the warm side of his personality, and leaves behind the hostility, anger and gross-out humor. To be sure, there's projectile vomiting on a vast scale in an opening scene of the movie, but it's performed by a walrus, not one of the human characters, and the walrus feels a lot better afterward. This is a kinder and gentler Adam Sandler.</p><p>He plays Henry Roth, a marine biologist at a Hawaiian sea world, healing walruses, sea lions and dolphins and moonlighting as an expert in one-night stands. He romances babes who are in Hawaii on vacation, and then forgets them when they go home, so imagine his amazement when he meets Lucy and finds that she forgets him every night.</p><p>Lucy is surrounded by a lot of support (her loving dad and the staff at the local diner), and they're dubious about the motives of this guy who says he's so much in love he's willing to start over with this girl every morning.</p><p>You'd think it would be hard to construct an arc for a story that starts fresh every day, but George Wing's screenplay ingeniously uses videotape to solve that problem -- so that Lucy gets a briefing every morning on what she has missed, and makes daily notes in a journal about her strange romance with Henry. Eventually this leads her to conclude that it's unfair to Henry to have to endure her daily memory losses, and she says she wants to break up. Of course the formula requires this, but how the movie solves it is kind of charming.</p><p>The movie doesn't have the complexity and depth of \"Groundhog Day\" (which I recently saw described as \"the most spiritual film of our time\"), but as entertainment it's ingratiating and lovable. And it suggests that Sandler, whose movies are so often based on hostility, has another speed, another tone, that plays very nicely.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>Adam (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/joseph-gordon-levitt\">Joseph Gordon-Levitt</a>) is a writer for public radio in Seattle, which makes him almost a poster boy for someone who should grow old and wise. He has a nagging back pain. He ends up in the office of an oncologist, who tells him it is a rare form of cancer of the spine. \"50/50\" was written by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/will-reiser\">Will Reiser</a>, who himself was diagnosed with a spinal tumor. <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/seth-rogen\">Seth Rogen</a>, who plays Adam's best friend, Kyle, is a close friend of Reiser in real life, and the movie is based on what happened in their friendship after the diagnosis.</p><p>After surgery and treatment, Reiser is currently in the sixth year of remission and cheerfully observes, \"Remission apparently lasts forever  or until you die.\" In an interview by Jen Chaney with the two of them in the Washington Post, they joke endlessly, which is perhaps inevitable between a comedy writer and a comic actor, and although \"50/50\" is structured with the efficiency of a sitcom, there's an undercurrent of truth and real feeling.</p><p>Adam turns to his best buddy for support and encouragement. Kyle rises to the occasion, unlike Rachael (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/bryce-dallas-howard\">Bryce Dallas Howard</a>), his girlfriend, who (as he learns) wasn't all that committed even before the awful diagnosis. Rachael of course vows to stand by and help him, as society says we must do, but in fact, cancer is a messy and depressing business, and she signed on to be a girlfriend, not a nurse. She doesn't have the right stuff. And believe me, the challenges Adam presents for her in \"50/50\" are nothing compared to real life. If you've been involved in the case of a loved one with cancer, you'll observe that this girl gets off easy.</p><p>Adam is also supported, maybe too much, by his mother, Diane (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/anjelica-huston\">Anjelica Huston</a>), who actually moves into his house. Her husband has Alzheimer's, and she's stuck by him, so she has the right stuff, but when you're sick, you need quiet time and the constant presence of a determined mother is not always what's called for.</p><p>The movie places Adam in a cancer patients' support group, where fellow patient Alan (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/philip-baker-hall\">Philip Baker Hall</a>) provides dry, realistic input. Alan is a model of acceptance, the fifth stage in Elisabeth Kbler-Ross' \"Five Stages of Grief.\" His work here is a reminder of what an effective actor Hall always is. <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/anna-kendrick\">Anna Kendrick</a> plays Katherine, Adam's therapist, who gets just as involved as his oncologist is aloof. I know therapists are supposed to observe a certain distance, but in a case like this, I don't see how one can. I would make a terrible therapist.</p><p>The screenplay perhaps benefits from Reiser's experience on TV and proceeds in an orderly way through a basic sitcom structure. Some of the comedy aspects may seem unlikely, but Seth Rogen has a winning way about him and reveals genuine affection. If a movie like this were as relentlessly realistic as a masterpiece like Mike Nichols' \"Wit,\" it would probably not be commercial and end up, as \"Wit\" did, on HBO. A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.</p><p>What I appreciated was the third act. Sitcoms and film comedies in general have a way of going haywire with comic desperation toward the end. This one doesn't. Director <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jonathan-levine\">Jonathan Levine</a> (\"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-wackness-2008\">The Wackness</a>\") has established the characters with enough care that the audience is prepared when they reveal greater depth toward the end. Anjelica Huston is especially good at breaking free of what seem to be the boundaries of her role.</p><p>\"50/50\" isn't completely true to life, but the more you know about cancer, the less you want it to be. Like another recent feel-good film about the disease, Gus Van Sant's \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/restless-2011\">Restless</a>,\" it creates a comforting myth. That's one of the things movies are good for.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\">We never remember in chronological order, especially when were going back over a failed romance. We start near the end, and then hop around between the times that were good and the times that left pain. People always say start at the beginning, but we didnt know at the time it was the beginning. \"500 Days of Summer\" is a movie that works that way.</span><br></p><p>Some say theyre annoyed by the way it begins on Day 488 or whatever and then jumps around, providing utterly unhelpful data labels: \"Day 1,\" \"Day 249.\" Movies are supposed to reassure us that events unfold in an orderly procession. But Tom remembers his love, Summer, as a series of joys and bafflements. What kind of woman likes you perfectly sincerely and has no one else in her life but is not interested in ever getting married?</p><p><a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/zooey-deschanel\">Zooey Deschanel</a> is a good choice to play such a woman. I cant imagine her playing a clinging vine. Too ornery. As Summer, she sees Tom with a level gaze and is who she is. Its Toms bad luck she is sweet and smart and beautiful  its not an act. She is always scrupulously honest with him. She is her own person, and Tom cant have her. </p><p>Have you known someone like that? In romance, we believe what we want to believe. Thats the reason \"500 Days of Summer\" is so appealing. Tom is in love with Summer from the moment he sees her. His thoughts on love may not run as deeply as, say, those of the Romantic poets. He writes greeting cards, and you suspect he may believe his own cards. Its amazing people get paid for a job like that. I could do it: \"Love is a rose, and you are its petals.\" Summer is his boss's new assistant. She likes his looks, and makes her move one day over the Xerox machine. </p><p>Can he accept that she simply likes him for now, not for forever? The movie, which is a delightful comedy, alive with invention, is about Tom wrestling with that reality. The director <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/marc-webb\">Marc Webb</a> seems to be casting about for templates from other movies to help him tell this story; thats not desperation, but playfulness. Theres a little black and white, a little musical number, a little Fellini, which is always helpful in evoking a man in the act of yearning. Tom spends this movie in the emotional quandary of Mastroianni in \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-la-dolce-vita-1960\">La Dolce Vita</a>,\" his hand always outstretched toward his inaccessible fantasies.</p><p>Summer remains mysterious all through the film, perhaps because we persist with Tom in expecting her to cave in. When we realize she is not required to in this movie, because its not playing by the Hollywood rules, we perk up; anything could happen. The kaleidoscopic time structure breaks the shackles of the three-act grid and thrashes about with the freedom of romantic confusion.</p><p>One thing men love is to instruct women. If a woman wants to enchant a man, she is wise to play his pupil. Men fall for this. Tom set out in life to be an architect, not a poet of greeting cards. He and Summer share the same favorite view of Los Angeles (one you may not have seen before), and he conducts for her an architectural tour. This is fun not because we get to see wonderful buildings, but because so rarely in the movies do we find characters arguing for their aesthetic values. What does your average character played by an A-list star believe about truth and beauty? Has Jason Bourne ever gone to a museum on his day off?</p><p><a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/joseph-gordon-levitt\">Joseph Gordon-Levitt</a> has acted in a lot of movies, ranging from one of the \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/halloween-1979\">Halloween</a>\" sequels to the indie gem \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/brick-2006\">Brick</a>.\" He comes into focus here playing a believable, likable guy, hopeful, easily disappointed, a little Tom Hanksian. He is strong enough to expect love, weak enough to be hurt. Zooey Deschanel evokes that ability in some women to madden you with admiration while never seeming to give it the slightest thought. She also had that quality in the overlooked \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/gigantic-2009\">Gigantic</a>\" (2008), although the movies peculiar supporting characters obscured it.</p><p>Tom opens the film by announcing it will not be your typical love story. Are you like me, and when you realize a movie is on autopilot you get impatient with it? How long can the characters pretend they dont know how the story will end? Here is a rare movie that begins by telling us how it will end and is about how the hero has no idea why.</p><p>Note: The movies poster insists the title is \"(500) Days of Summer.\" Led by Variety, every single film critic whose review I could find has simply ignored that punctuation. Good for them.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>That's the compelling, universal hook for <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/doug-block\">Doug Block</a>'s \"51 Birch Street,\" an irresistible mystery in the form of a documentary about an ordinary family -- <i>his</i> -- who finds out it's not quite, and never was, what it seemed to have been, even to the people living in it. The great enigma at the core of this movie is the one at the heart of every family: Who <i>are</i> these people, our parents? How much can we really know about them, and how much do we want to know?</p><p>The reverberating ironies of \"51 Birch Street\" begin with this one: Doug Block -- son, brother, husband, documentary filmmaker, wedding videographer -- begins using his digital camcorder to better connect with his parents, particularly his father, to whom he's never been particularly close, and to document a little family history for himself and his sisters. While Doug pays some bills filming couples celebrating their first moments together as husbands and wives, his parents celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary.</p><p>The story of the film, and of these modest lives, seems to be following its natural and predictable course. Early on, while setting up a shot of his mother, Doug attempts to do a little psychological digging, asking her if he's like his father. \"Oh, come on, now,\" she says. \"What're you trying -- you're looking for direct <i>things</i>? Nothing ever is direct. It's circuitous. Everything is circuitous. It goes around in very unpredictable ways.\" Yes, it does. Like her language. Like the movie.</p><p>\"51 Birch Street\" is one of those great documentaries that could not have been realized until the late 20th century. Not because of cutting-edge technology, but because of accessible consumer technology that made it possible to assemble and draw upon a library of home movies and video. The filmmaker could not have known, when he began shooting this footage of himself and his family, what form it would eventually take, or what subtle revelations he would (circuitously) discover within it.</p><p>Unlike the similarly home-made family narrative of \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/capturing-the-friedmans-2003\">Capturing The Friedmans</a>,\" there's no sensational allegation hiding in the basement at \"51 Birch Street,\" though what Block does discover, like a 30-year cache of his mother's private journals, is enough to throw anyone for a loop. What should he do? What would you do? Unless it's happened to you, don't be too sure you know the answer in advance.</p><p>This personal, lovingly hand-crafted film offers a down-to-earth corrective to decades of comedies and romances from the Hollywood fantasy-factory that faded out on the climactic kiss at the altar. In 1930, the Gershwins wrote that \"every happy plot ends with a marriage knot.\" But the marriage continues after the curtain closes on the plot -- and there are years of behind-closed-doors adjustments, re-evaluations and accommodations ahead.</p><p>A house always becomes a psychological model of its inhabitants, a projection of the personalities within. And so, \"51 Birch Street\" (named after the Port Washington, Long Island, address where Doug and his sisters grew up) is also about returning to a house that was once your home. We visit dad in his cellar workshop, where he has long taken refuge from the activity upstairs.</p><p>And, in an indelibly haunting memory-image that evokes <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/max-ophuls\">Max Ophuls</a> as well as <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/stanley-kubrick\">Stanley Kubrick</a>, we watch from a landing halfway up the stairs as mom moves from the bedroom to the bathroom in order to avoid being photographed from an unflattering low angle. \"You destroy trust!\" she says from behind the bathroom door. And she's joking, but she's not just joking. The next time we see these rooms from this position on the landing, the bedroom is being packed up.</p><p>Dad, who's habitually trying to give Doug things from around the house, makes his rounds from room to room, looking for some leftover thing his son might take away with him. But Doug isn't looking for objects. What he's seeking is already right there, in his frame.</p><p>The house will still be 51 Birch Street, even when there are no longer any Blocks living there, but it won't be a place any of them can go back to. Except in their memories, and this film. And the place they'll rediscover is not the one they knew as children, but one that never existed before, in which everyone in the family is a grown-up, with a greater understanding of what it means to be a family, and to love, and maybe to accept a few regrets along the way.</p>",

    ],
    "formatted_review_text": "<p>The old golden age Warner Bros. crime dramas knew something that most modern movies have forgotten: Heroes are great, but a movie is only as good as its villain. John Frankenheimer's \"52 Pick-Up\" provides us with the best, most reprehensible villain of the year and uses his vile charm as the starting point for a surprisingly good film.</p><p>The villain's name is Raimy, and he is played by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/john-glover\">John Glover</a> as a charming blackmailer with the looks of an aging British juvenile and a conscience with parts on order. He tries to pull a slick job on a rich businessman named Harry (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/roy-scheider\">Roy Scheider</a>). He shows him videotapes of an affair Harry is having with a topless dancer. He wants $110,000. Harry thinks it over, decides not to pay and confesses everything to his wife, Barbara (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/ann-margret\">Ann-Margret</a>). In a scene of powerful understatement she says she had guessed the truth for a long time but she just doesn't know why he had to tell her. Then Raimy turns up with another videotape. This one shows the topless dancer being murdered with Harry's gun.</p><p>This plot is not startlingly original (although there are some unexpected developments later in the film). What makes it special is the level at which it is told. The screenplay is based on an <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/elmore-leonard\">Elmore Leonard</a> novel and retains Leonard's gift for terse, colorful dialogue.</p><p>It also isolates the key ingredient in Leonard's best novels, which is the sight of a marginal character being pushed far beyond his capacity to cope. In \"52 Pick-Up,\" there are three such characters, and by the end of the movie they are all desperately confused and frightened.</p><p>One is Raimy, a well-dressed sleazebag who makes porno movies and is capable of cold-blooded murder but caves in completely at the thought of his own destruction. One is Harry, an ordinary amoral businessman who rises to the challenge and figures out a way to outsmart his blackmailers by using their character defects against them. The third is a sweaty little guy named Leo (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/robert-trebor\">Robert Trebor</a>), who works for Raimy and went along with the crime but, holy God, never figured anyone was actually going to get hurt.</p><p>The problem with so many action adventures is that nobody in the movie ever seems scared enough. People are getting killed in every other scene, and they stay cool. If the movies were like real life and this kind of torture and murder were going on, everybody would be throwing up every five minutes - like they do in John D. MacDonald's novels. \"52 Pick-Up\" creates that sense of hopelessness and desperation, and it does it with those three performances - three guys who are in way over their heads and know it all too well.</p><p>There are three other good performances in the movie, by Ann-Margret, Vanity and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/clarence-williams-iii\">Clarence Williams III</a> (as a black pimp who is a lot more experienced about violence and death than his cheerful white partners). Is it still necessary to be surprised when Ann-Margret is good in a role, as if she were still making \"Viva Las Vegas\"? She has grown into a dependable serious actress, and here she does a delicate job of finding the line between anger at what her husband has done and pride in how he is trying to fix it. Vanity has a smaller role, as a prostitute with crucial information, and she does what all good character actors can do: She gives us the sense that she's fresh from intriguing offscreen action.</p><p>The story of \"52 Pick-Up\" is basically revenge melodrama. No thriller fan is going to be very astonished. What matters is the energy level and the density of detail in the performances. This is a well-crafted movie by a man who knows how to hook the audience with his story; it's Frankenheimer's best work in years. And if we can sometimes predict what the characters will do, there's the fascination of seeing them behave like unique and often very weird individuals. They aren't clones. I have gotten to the point where the one thing I know about most thrillers is that I will not be thrilled. \"52 Pick-Up\" blind-sided me.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>On the sixth day, God created man. And man should leave it at that, according to laws that have been passed in \"The 6th Day,\" Arnold Schwarzenegger's new thriller. In the near future there's a RePet store in every mall that will clone your dead pet for you, but human cloning, although technically possible, has been outlawed.</p><p>There is, however, a clandestine market in human clones. Consider the case of Johnny Phoenix, a pro quarterback who's paid $300 million a season, but is brain-dead after a game injury. \"We have a lifetime contract with a vegetable,\" one of the team owners moans, before pulling the plug on Johnny's life-support system (\"Sorry, Johnny--you're gonna have to take one for the team\"). Sad, yes, but whaddaya know: Soon Johnny is back out there quarterbacking again.</p><p>All of this is miles away from the life of Adam Gibson (Schwarzenegger), a helicopter pilot who with his buddy Hank (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/michael-rapaport\">Michael Rapaport</a>) airlifts rich skiers to the slopes. Adam has a happy home life with his wife, Natalie (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/wendy-crewson\">Wendy Crewson</a>), and daughter, marred only by the death of their pet dog Oliver. Should Adam have Oliver cloned at RePet? He doesn't think so. He thinks there's something wrong about overturning the fundamental process of life and death.</p><p>Adam's friend Hank has fewer scruples, and enjoys life with a computer-generated holographic Perfect Virtual Woman, who greets him after a long day: \"I've recorded all your sports programs. Maybe we could watch them together. Or should I just take this dress off right now?\" (There is a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit there somewhere, about a hard-pressed man taking Viagra to keep up with the insatiable willingness of his Virtual Woman. Perhaps she could be adjusted to say, \"Honey, tonight I only feel like a pineapple and pepperoni pizza, a six-pack, and watching you clean your guns.\") Cloning in \"The 6th Day\" has made great leaps forward since the days of the sheep named Dolly. The cloners don't start with a cloned fertilized egg. Instead, they grow \"blanks\"--assemblies of protoplasm floating in a nurturing fluid, ready to have the total mind and body information of adults plugged into them. Using a quick eye scan, the cloners can make a \"syncording\" of the contents of a pet's mind, so it will still recognize its owner and know all the same tricks. And the same thing is done illegally in the movie with humans, by a shadowy corporation run by Drucker (the handsomely reptilian <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/tony-goldwyn\">Tony Goldwyn</a>). <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/robert-duvall\">Robert Duvall</a> is the brilliant scientist for the corporation, but has his doubts.</p><p>This process sounds like the Soul Catcher that has been hypothesized by Arthur C. Clarke--the memory chip into which the contents of a human mind might be downloaded. My problem with both processes is that while the resulting clone or chip might know everything I know and remember everything that ever happened to me and think of itself as me, I myself would still be over here in the old container. Immortality for my perfect clone leaves behind what I insist upon considering the real me--something the Goldwyn character has time to reflect on during a melodramatic dying scene.</p><p>Such details do not slow the evil corporation, fueled by the genius of Dr. Weir (Robert Duvall) and prodded by the seductive, ruthless Talia (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/sara-wynter\">Sara Wynter</a>). They have a scheme to kill and clone Hank, Adam's friend, but by mistake they clone Adam instead, leaving the movie populated by two Arnold Schwarzeneggers who both think they're the real thing. Since that is how most Schwarzenegger movies feel, this is not as confusing as it sounds.</p><p>This much you know from the trailers. What happens next I will not say, although of course it involves meetings both astonished and poignant between the two Adams, whose wife is named Natalie and not Eve only through the superhuman resolve of the screenwriters.</p><p>\"The 6th Day\" is not in the same league with the great Schwarzenegger films such as \"Total Recall\" and \"Terminator 2,\" but it's a well-crafted entertainment containing enough ideas to qualify it as science fiction and not just as a futurist thriller. Schwarzenegger once again gets mileage out of the contrast between his muscular presence and his everyman persona; at one point, he has dialogue that slyly pairs the two: \"My little girl--I don't want to expose her to any graphic violence. She gets enough of that from the media.\" Both Drucker and Talia have been cloned many times, causing us to wonder how much they enjoy starting over, and whether any regrets are left behind in the process. We'll never know: The discarded entities left behind in the cloning process have no way to complain. Instead of living forever through the genes you give to your children, you live forever through reproducing your own genes, which brings evolution to a dead stop, of course. Could you make a Syncording of yourself as a child, grow up, clone the kid and bring up yourself as your own child? Speculations like these are inspired by \"The 6th Day,\" and are part of the fun.</p>",

    ],
    "formatted_review_text": "<p>Having met <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/peter-greenaway\">Peter Greenaway</a>, I find it easier to understand the tone of his films. Not a lighthearted man, he is cerebral, controlled, is so precise in his speech he seems to be dictating. \"He talks like a university lecturer,\" I wrote after meeting him in 1991, \"and gives the impression he would rather dine alone than suffer bores at his table.\" Yet there is an aggressive, almost violent, streak of comedy in his makeup; one can imagine him, like Hitchcock, springing practical jokes.</p><p>Consider a scene in \"8 1/2 Women,\" his new film. It takes place in a staid Swiss cemetery. His hero, Philip Emmenthal (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/john-standing\">John Standing</a>), is a billionaire who has just lost his beloved wife. He arrives at the services dressed in a white summer suit because his wife disliked dark clothing. He is informed that a black suit is absolutely required according to the bylaws.</p><p>Enraged, defiant, stubborn, Philip grimly strips down until he is standing naked on the gravel; observing the letter of the law, he demands even black underwear. He is surrounded by minions who lend him their own clothing--a black shirt, black tie, pants, coat, even underwear (\"it looks like a swimming suit,\" its wearer explains, \"and I was hoping to go swimming later\"). His decision has forced his employees to strip as well, and now, dressed in black, he walks a few feet to one side and we see what we could not see before--that the preacher and all of the mourners were waiting nearby, in full view of everything.</p><p>Now how is this funny? Trying to imagine other kinds of comedies handling the material, I ran it through Monty Python, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/steve-martin\">Steve Martin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/woody-allen\">Woody Allen</a> before realizing it has its roots in Buster Keaton--whose favorite comic ploy was to overcome obstacles by applying pure logic and ignoring social conventions or taboos. Keaton would have tilted it more toward laughs, to be sure; Greenaway's humor always seems dour, and masks (not very well) a lot of hostility. But, yes, Keaton.</p><p>One possible approach to \"8 1/2 Women,\" I think, is to view it as a slowed-down, mannered, tongue-in-cheek silent comedy, skewed by Greenaway's anger and desire to manipulate. The movie's title evokes memories of the ways Greenaway numbers, categorizes, sorts and orders the characters in his other films. His titles like \"Drowning by Numbers\" and \"A Zed and Two Noughts\" show the same sensibility; he distances himself from the humanity of his characters by treating them like inventory.</p><p>Here, however, real emotion is allowed to fight its way onto the screen. Philip is in genuine mourning for his dead wife (\"Who will hold and comfort me now that she's gone?\"), and his hopelessness moves his son Storey (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/matthew-delamere\">Matthew Delamere</a>). There is a scene, offscreen but unmistakably implied, in which they have incestuous sex, perhaps as a form of mutual comfort, and many scenes in which Greenaway, so interested in male nudity, has them naked in front of mirrors and each other. This is not the nudity of sexuality, but of disclosure; a billionaire stripped of his clothes (and his Rolls Royces and chateaus and servants) is just after all a naked man with flat feet and a belly.</p><p>Father and son have been involved in a scheme to take over a series of pachinko parlors in Kyoto, Japan. Pachinko is an addictive form of pinball, much prized by the Japanese. They meet a woman who has gambled away most of her family's money on pachinko, and are surprised to discover that her father and her fiancee both suggest she sleep with Storey (or Philip) to work off the debt. (This does not represent a loss of honor, the translator explains, because the Emmenthals are not Japanese, thus do not count).</p><p>This woman becomes one of the first of eight and a half women the father and son move into their Geneva mansion, in an attempt to slake their grief with the pleasures of the flesh. All of the women are willing participants, for reasons of their own--the one in the bizarre body brace, the one unhappy unless she is pregnant, an amputee who only counts as a half, and so on. Greenaway deliberately does not build or shoot any of the movie's many sex scenes in a revealing or erotic way; they are always about power, manipulation, control.</p><p>Apart from the father's real scenes of grief, the film is cold and distant. It shows its bones as well as its skin; some of its shots are superimposed on pages from the screenplay that describes them. It is not possible to \"like\" this film, although one admires it, and is intrigued.</p><p>Greenaway does not much require to be liked (is my guess), and what he is doing here has links to deep feelings he reveals only indirectly. At two times in the film, father and son watch Fellini's \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-8-12--eight-and-a-half-1963\">8 1/2</a>,\" particularly the scene where the hero gathers all of the women in his life into the same room and tries to tame and placate them. After the second viewing, the father asks the son, \"How many film directors make films to satisfy their sexual fantasies?\" \"Most of them,\" his son replies. This one for sure.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>8 Heads in a Duffel Bag sounds, I know, like a miniseries inspired by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-bring-me-the-head-of-alfredo-garcia-1974\">Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia</a>. But the movie's roots are in screwball comedy, and occasionally it does approach the zaniness it yearns for. It stars <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/joe-pesci\">Joe Pesci</a> as a gangster whose mission is to deliver the heads of eight gangsters to a man in San Diego who will accept them, not unreasonably, as evidence that their owners are dead.</p>\r<p>Pesci's duffel bag is switched at an airport with an identical bag owned by Charlie (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/andy-comeau\">Andy Comeau</a>), a medical student headed for a Mexican vacation with his fiancee. He has enough problems. His beloved, Laurie (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/kristy-swanson\">Kristy Swanson</a>), is no longer sure she wants to marry him. Under the influence of her alcoholic mother (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/dyan-cannon\">Dyan Cannon</a>) and deeply tanned father (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/george-hamilton\">George Hamilton</a>), she has changed. Look at you! Charlie cries. Six months at home and you've mutated from a fun-loving free spirit into. . . into. . . Nancy Reagan! Spinelli, the Pesci character, has 24 hours to find those heads. Using clues in Charlie's bag, he visits the kid's fraternity house and tortures two of his frat brothers (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/david-spade\">David Spade</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/todd-louiso\">Todd Louiso</a>) to find out Charlie's vacation plans. I've seen a lot of torture methods in the movies, but never one as ingenious as this: He makes them put on their stethoscopes, and then bangs the little metal discs together. They talk.</p>\r<p>Meanwhile, in Mexico, Charlie has discovered the heads in his bag. So has the resort's pet dog, who sniffs out the secret, and would have gotten more laughs if they'd cast a truly funny dog, like a Chihuahua. Spinelli and the fraternity brothers fly to Mexico for the climax, which involves at one point as many as 14 heads, I believe, along with much debate about whether it's murder if you thaw out a cryogenically-frozen person.</p>\r<p>Joe Pesci is the best thing in the movie; he's funny every moment he's on the screen. None of the other characters are fully realized, and the two most promising--Hamilton and Cannon--aren't onscreen enough. Andy Comeau, as Charlie, doesn't generate the madness the role requires. He seems merely frenzied when he needs to seem crazed. For screwball comedy to work, there has to be a frightening intensity in the characters. The plots are always threatening to spin out of control, and their single-minded urgency is needed to keep the story grounded. Everyone here, except Pesci, is just a little too comfortable.</p>\r<p>Pesci has a lot of scenes that strike just the right note, as when he gets into a fight with a flight attendant over whether he can put his oversize bag into the overhead compartment. Consider his dilemma: He's desperate, because the heads need to be in San Diego. He's trapped, because if he protests too much they'll throw him off the plane. Anger and ferocity lurk just beneath the surface, but he can't explode or he'll get in trouble with the airline. Pesci finds a great actor's solution to the scene: He's not fighting with the attendant, he's fighting with himself. (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jim-carrey\">Jim Carrey</a> did the same sort of thing in Liar, Liar.) He has other good scenes, including one in which George Hamilton's mother gets on his nerves, and he sends her on a quick tour of the Mexican mountains.</p>\r<p>But the others in the cast aren't at his level, and scenes that should be funnier (as when a blind laundress pops a head in the dryer) lack focus and a payoff. We also get an unnecessary Mexican youth gang, which surrounds Charlie and laughs maniacally while calling him a gringo, simply because every single time a gringo gets lost in Mexico it is written in the clouds that he must be surrounded and laughed at maniacally. (Did this cliche start with Alfonso Bedoya in Treasure of the Sierra Madre, or is it even older?) 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag, written and directed by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/tom-schulman\">Tom Schulman</a>, takes a lot of chances, and if they'd all worked it might have been a great comedy--its combination of Mafia logic and grotesque humor might have propelled it toward the success of a triumph like <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/bound-1996\">Bound</a>. But it doesn't scale those heights. It stops at the foothills, and only Pesci continues, climbing on alone.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>Pale, depressed, Jimmy Smith Jr. (Eminem) skulks through a life that has been so terribly unkind to him. His girlfriend has gotten pregnant and broken up with him, and although he did the right thing by her--he gave her his old car--he now faces the prospect of moving back into his mother's trailer home, with her boyfriend who hates him. Jimmy carries his clothes around in a garbage bag. He has a job as a punch press operator.</p><p>We see him, early in \"8 Mile,\" about to do the only thing he does well and takes joy in doing. He is about to go onstage at the Shelter, a rap club that looks uncannily like a deserted building, and engage in the hip-hop version of a poetry slam. In this world, he is known as \"Rabbit.\" He rehearses in a mirror in the men's room, fiercely scowling at his own reflection and practicing those hand gestures all the rappers use, their outboard fingers pointed down from jerking arms as they jab spastically like Joe Cocker. Then Rabbit throws up. Then he goes onstage, where he has 45 seconds to out-rap his competitor in a showdown. And then he freezes. The seconds creep by in total silence, until Rabbit flees the stage and the Shelter.</p><p>We are hardly started in \"8 Mile,\" and already we see that this movie stands aside from routine debut films by pop stars. It stands aside from Britney Spears and the <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/spice-girls\">Spice Girls</a> and the other hit machines who have unwisely tried to transfer musical ability into acting careers. Like Prince's \"Purple Rain,\" it is the real thing. Eminem insists on Rabbit's proletarian roots, on his slattern mother, on his lonely progress as a white boy in a black world.</p><p>Whether \"8 Mile\" is close to Eminem's own autobiographical truths, I do not know. It is a faithful reflection of his myth, however, beginning with the title, which refers to the road which separates Detroit from its white suburbs. He lives on the black side of the road, where he has found acceptance and friendship from a posse of homies, and especially from Future (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/mekhi-phifer\">Mekhi Phifer</a>), who emcees the contests at the Shelter. When Rabbit gets into fights with black rivals, and he does, they are motivated not by racism but by more wholesome feelings, like sexual jealousy and professional envy.</p><p>The genius of Rabbit is to admit his own weaknesses. This is also the approach of Eminem, who acknowledges in his lyrics that he's a white man playing in a black man's field. In the climactic performance scene in \"8 Mile,\" he not only skewers his opponent but preempts any comeback by trashing himself first, before the other guy can. At one point, devastatingly, he even calls another rapper \"too generic.\" They must read rock critics in the inner city.</p><p>The movie, directed by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/curtis-hanson\">Curtis Hanson</a> (\"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/wonder-boys-2000\">Wonder Boys</a>\") and written by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/scott-silver\">Scott Silver</a>, is a grungy version of a familiar formula, in which the would-be performer first fails at his art, then succeeds, is unhappy in romance but lucky in his friends, and comes from an unfortunate background. He even finds love, sort of, with Alex (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/brittany-murphy\">Brittany Murphy</a>), who is loyal if not faithful. What the movie is missing, however, is the third act in which the hero becomes a star. We know that Eminem is awesomely successful, but \"8 Mile\" avoids the rags-to-riches route and shows Rabbit moving from rags to slightly better rags.</p><p>There has been criticism of <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/kim-basinger\">Kim Basinger</a>, who is said to be too attractive and even glamorous to play Rabbit's mother, but this strikes me as economic discrimination: Cannot poor people as well as rich people look like Kim Basinger? Given the numbers of ugly people who live in big houses, why can't there be beautiful people living in trailers? Her performance finds the right note somewhere between love and exasperation; it cannot be easy to live with this sullen malcontent, whose face lights up only when he sees his baby sister, Lily.</p><p>As an actor, Eminem is convincing without being electric. Perhaps the Rabbit character doesn't allow for joy; he seems to go through life forever remembering why he shouldn't be happy. As it happens, on the same day that \"8 Mile\" was screened in Chicago, I also saw \"Standing in the Shadows of Motown,\" a documentary about the studio musicians who created the Motown Sound. The contrast was instructive. On the one hand, a Detroit white boy embracing the emblems of poverty and performing in a musical genre that involves complaint, anger and alienation. On the other hand, black Detroit musicians making good money, performing joyously, having a good time and remembering those times with tears in their eyes. What has happened to our hopes, that young audiences now embrace such cheerless material, avoiding melody like the plague? At least in their puritanism they still permit rhymes.</p><p>Eminem survives the X-ray truth-telling of the movie camera, which is so good at spotting phonies. He is on the level. Here he plays, if not himself, a version of himself, and we understand why he has been accepted as a star in a genre mostly owned by blacks. Whether he has a future as a movie actor is open to question: At this point in his career, there is no reason for him to play anyone other than himself, and it might even be professionally dangerous for him to try. He can of course play versions of Rabbit in other movies, and would probably play them well, but Rabbit, let it be said, is a downer. I would love to see a sequel (maybe \"81/2 Mile\") in which Rabbit makes millions and becomes world famous, and we learn at last if it is possible for him to be happy.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>\"Eight Seconds\" comes billed as the true story of Lane Frost, one of the youngest national champions in rodeo history, who was able to win the title more easily than the approval of his father.</p><p>Obsessed by his father's need to always demand something more, he turned to his fans for easy approval, and that almost destroyed his marriage to a young horsewoman he met at a rodeo.cw-0 The movie is really more the story of the marriage than a story of rodeo. Lane, played by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/luke-perry\">Luke Perry</a> of \"Beverly Hills 90210,\" first sees Kellie Frost (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/cynthia-geary\">Cynthia Geary</a> of \"Northern Exposure\") during a competition, and likes her immediately. He is shy, but she makes it easy for him to get to know her, and her parents are also friendly: No wonder, for Lane is pleasant and ingratiating. They get married when they're both too young to understand the responsibilities of marriage, and then his career really takes off and he becomes a rodeo favorite.</p><p>One of the reasons for his popularity is his willingness to be friendly with the fans, to sign autographs and pose for pictures and give free advice to youngsters. A lot of the cowboys are too busy to pay attention to the public. Not Lane. But there's another side to the coin: Kellie is often left waiting alone while he tends to the public, and a lot of his generosity is actually just the desire to be admired and popular.</p><p>Soon their marriage begins to waver, complicated by his desire to do it all his way. That means they live in a third-hand house trailer, instead of in the nice home her wealthy father would build for them. And it means he spends a lot of time on the rodeo circuit with his buddies (especially best EL13L pal Tuff Hedeman, played by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/stephen-baldwin\">Stephen Baldwin</a>), instead of at home with his wife. Finally the marriage reaches a breaking point.</p><p>The story of the marriage is actually the best and most original thing in \"Eight Seconds.\" Most movies idealize young love and dismiss the practical problems of living happily ever after. I expected less psychology and more rodeo, especially since the film has been directed by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/john-g-avildsen\">John G. Avildsen</a>, of \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/rocky-1976\">Rocky</a>.\" But Perry and Geary do a good job of making the young couple believable, in a story that owes a lot to the movies: Specifically, to \"The Lusty Men\" (1952), Nicholas Ray's movie starring <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/robert-mitchum\">Robert Mitchum</a> as another rodeo hero whose fame makes trouble for his marriage.</p><p>If the marriage material in \"Eight Seconds\" is well done, oddly enough it's the rodeo footage that needs improvement. All I know about rodeos I know from the movies, especially from \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/junior-bonner-1972\">Junior Bonner</a>,\" Sam Peckinpah's 1972 film that starred <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/steve-mcqueen\">Steve McQueen</a>, and \"The Great American Cowboy\" (1974), a documentary by Keith Merrill. Those movies made it clear how difficult and dangerous it is to sit on the back of an angry bull for eight seconds. They dealt very closely with the details of what a rodeo cowboy does for a living.</p><p>\"Eight Seconds,\" on the other hand, observes the rodeo as a fan might, from the stands. There's not much arcane information, not many insights into how you get to be a rodeo cowboy, and what separates the good ones from the bad ones. Lane Frost turns out to be a very good one, but he seems to have had his talent from the first, and he is thrown so very, very rarely that he makes the sport look too easy.</p><p>Even a duel with a dreaded bull that has thrown more than 300 riders is set up for an inevitable outcome.</p><p>The film's ending, which I will not reveal, tempts us to like the movie simply because we feel sympathy for the characters. But that won't do. There's a certain slackness in \"Eight Seconds,\" a feeling that a lot of the material has been included simply because it happened in real life - not because it adds much to the story. The whole character of the best friend, Tuff, seems like a distraction; Lane often prefers to hit the circuit with Tuff instead of staying home with his bride, but this is not intrinsically very interesting, and the filmmakers should have either dropped Tuff, or written the character with more complexity.</p><p>The surprise in the movie, I guess, is Perry, whose name cannot appear in print without the words \"teen heartthrob\" attached to it.</p><p>Like earlier throbs (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/matt-dillon\">Matt Dillon</a> in particular) he looks capable of rising above the fanzine drivel and proving himself a real actor. But this isn't quite the movie.</p>",

Eight women are isolated in a snowbound cottage, there is a corpse with a knife in his back, all of the women are potential suspects, plus six song and dance numbers. The cast is a roll call of French legends. In alphabetical order: <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/fanny-ardant\">Fanny Ardant</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/emmanuelle-beart\">Emmanuelle Beart</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/danielle-darrieux\">Danielle Darrieux</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/catherine-deneuve\">Catherine Deneuve</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/isabelle-huppert\">Isabelle Huppert</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/virginie-ledoyen\">Virginie Ledoyen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/firmine-richard\">Firmine Richard</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/ludivine-sagnier\">Ludivine Sagnier</a>.</p><p>From the opening shot, the film cheerfully lets us know it's a spoof of overproduced Hollywood musicals. We pan past tree branches impossibly laden with picturesque snow and find a charming cottage where guests are just arriving. Eight women have gathered to celebrate Christmas with Marcel, who is the husband of Gaby (Deneuve), the son-in-law of Mamy (Darrieux), the brother-in-law of Aunt Augustine (Huppert), the father of Catherine (Sagnier) and Suzon (Ledoyen), the employer of the domestic servants Madame Chanel (Richard) and Louise (Beart), and the brother of the late-arriving Pierrette (Ardant).</p><p>\"Monsieur died in his bed with a knife in his back,\" the assembled company is informed. And (significant detail required in all isolated rural murders) \"the dogs didn't bark all night.\" The women absorb this news while dressed in stunning designer fashions (even the maids look chic) and deployed around a large, sunny room that looks like nothing so much as a stage set--even to the detail that all the furniture is behind the actresses most of the time. Only a couple of brief excursions upstairs prevent the movie from taking place entirely on this one bright set, where nothing looks used or lived with.</p><p>The artificiality is so jolly that we're not surprised when the first song begins, because \"8 Women\" is in no sense serious about murder, its plot, or anything else. It's an elaborate excuse to have fun with its cast, and we realize we've been waiting a long time for Catherine Deneuve to come right out and say of Isabelle Huppert: \"I'm beautiful and rich. She's ugly and poor.\" I had also just about given up hope of ever seeing Deneuve and Fanny Ardant rolling around on the floor pulling each other's hair.</p><p>In a cast where everybody has fun, Huppert has the most, as Augustine. She and her mother (Darrieux) have been living rent-free in Marcel's cottage with her sister (Deneuve), but that has not inspired Augustine to compromise in her fierce resentment and spinsterish isolation. She stalks around the set like Whistler's mother, frowning from behind her horn-rims and making disapproval into a lifestyle.</p><p>The other characters quickly fall into approved Agatha Christie patterns. Young Suzon appoints herself Sherlock Holmes, or perhaps in this case Hercule Poirot, and begins sniffing out the clues. The sexy Louise is established as the late Marcel's mistress. Madame Chanel, from French Africa, has been with the family for years and lives out back in the guest cottage, where, as it develops, she often plays cards with Pierrette. And Pierrette herself, who arrives late with the kind of entrance that only the tall, dark and forcible Ardant could pull off, has secrets which are as amazing as they are inevitable.</p><p>I dare not reveal a shred of the plot. And the movie is all plot--that, and stylish behavior, and barbed wit, and those musical numbers. Watching \"8 Women,\" you have a silly grin half of the time. Astonishing, that <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/francois-ozon\">Francois Ozon</a>, who directed this, also made \"Under the Sand\" (2001), that melancholy record of a wife (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/charlotte-rampling\">Charlotte Rampling</a>) whose husband disappears, apparently drowned, and who refuses to deal with the fact that he is dead.</p><p>Movies like \"8 Women\" are essentially made for movie-lovers. You have to have seen overdecorated studio musicals, and you have to know who Darrieux and Deneuve and Beart and Huppert and Ardant are, to get the full flavor. It also helps if you have seen Agatha Christie's \"The Mousetrap,\" now in the 50th year of its London run, with its cast still trapped with the corpse in the isolated cottage. \"Do not give away the secret!\" the program notes exhort. And here, too. Not that the secret is anything more than one more twist of the plot's pepper mill.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>Miss Fiske would have loved this movie. And I would have loved seeing it with her, through her eyes. I almost even loved it myself, because \"84 Charing Cross Road\" is a movie made for people who love London and books. The only problem is that the heroine doesn't get to London until it's too late, and nobody ever seems to read in this movie.</p><p>The film is based on a hit London and New York play, which was based on a best-selling book. Given the thin and unlikely subject matter, that already is a series of miracles. And yet there are people who are pushovers for this material. I should know. I read the book and I saw the play and now I am reviewing the movie, and I still don't think the basic idea is sound.</p><p>The story begins in the years right after World War II, when London was still gripped by food rationing and pocked by bomb craters.</p><p>A New York woman (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/anne-bancroft\">Anne Bancroft</a>), who loves books but cannot afford expensive ones, sees an ad in the Saturday Review for a London bookstore. She sends them her want list and is soon delighted to receive a package of used books - good readable editions, cheap. She begins a correspondence with the bookseller (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/anthony-hopkins\">Anthony Hopkins</a>), and thus commences a relationship that lasts for years without the two people ever meeting each other.</p><p>There is not a lot of drama in this story. Most of the action takes place in the post office. The director, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/david-jones\">David Jones</a>, does what he can. His previous film was Harold Pinter's \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/betrayal-1983\">Betrayal</a>,\" which was a love story told backward, beginning with the unhappy conclusion and ending with the lovers' first kiss. Now he has a love story in which the lovers do not meet. What can he look forward to next: autoeroticism? Bancroft sends care packages of ham to postwar England. Hopkins sends precious editions of Boswell, Chesterton and Cardinal Newman (\"Dear John Henry,\" Bancroft calls him). Bancroft leads a lonely life in a New York apartment. Hopkins occupies a silent marriage in a London bedroom suburb. After many years, Hopkins dies and then Bancroft finally goes to London and visits the now-empty bookstore.</p><p>Sigh. Miss Fiske, who you may remember from the first paragraph of this review, was the librarian at the Urbana Free Library when I was growing up. She instilled such a love of books in me that I still search used bookstore for the adventures of the Melody Family, by Elizabeth Enright; those were the first \"real books\" I read. Miss Fiske ran the book club and the Saturday morning puppet shows and the book fairs and the story readings. She never had to talk to me about the love of books because she simply exuded it and I absorbed it.</p><p>She would have loved this movie. Sitting next to her, I suspect, I would have loved it, too. But Miss Fiske is gone now, and I found it pretty slow-going on my own. And for that matter, Miss Fiske had a sharp critical intelligence, and I suspect that after seeing this movie she would have nodded and said she enjoyed it, but then she might have added, \"Why didn't that silly woman get on the boat and go to London 10 years sooner and save herself all that postage?\"</p>",

The premise of the movie is that a documentary (mopic) is being made about a patrol, and all of the footage in the film is seen through a camera being carried along by a filmmaker assigned to the unit.</p>\r<p>Its a style that makes the action feel immediate and unrehearsed; the soldiers address the camera as if theyre talking to the man whos carrying it, and the effect is that theyre talking to us. The strength here is that the movie seems to happen as we watch it.</p>\r<p>The trade off is that the director has less freedom to pick and choose his shots for dramatic effect; once he establishes the point of view, hes stuck with it.</p>\r<p>The first-person point of view has rarely been used for an entire film (Robert Montgomery made the camera into a private eye in Lady in the Lake, and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/orson-welles\">Orson Welles</a> once wanted to film Heart of Darkness through the eyes of various protagonists, including a bird), but Duncans angle in 84 Charlie MoPic is intriguing: By explaining the presence of the camera, he gives a realistic basis to the technique, instead of using it as pure style.</p>\r<p>The story of 84 Charlie MoPic is not original, nor was it meant to be. Anyone who has seen a fair number of war films will recognize the various types of characters in the platoon - the natural leader, the newcomer, the scared youngster - but what is original to this film is the sense of reality that Duncan is able to recapture. The types are familiar but what happens to them is not predictable, and the story takes the sudden, unexpected turns of real warfare rather than the manufactured developments of a Hollywood plot. As the patrol gets lost in the Central Highlands of Vietnam and finds itself in deeper and deeper trouble, we begin to feel the senselessness of their mission; their training helps them only to a point, and then they are in the hands of luck, or fate.</p>\r<p>All of this is seen through the eyes of MoPic, the cameraman, and what makes his subjective camera convincing is that he is not simply recording the action, but trying to make a documentary that can be used as a training film for other infantrymen. The six members of the reconnaissance unit are more or less experienced in the field, and they share their experience and lore with the camera; its like giving a briefing to trainees. The film is filled with dozens of tiny details that only a field veteran like Duncan would know about: the danger of smoking, for example, when cigarettes can be smelled on the wind for hundreds of yards and instantly identified as American tobacco. This kind of minutiae somehow adds up to more suspense than any number of mysterious shadows in the jungle.</p>\r<p>The subjective camera is probably responsible for many of the weaknesses of 84 Charlie MoPic, as well as its strengths. Duncan knows more about war than he knows about dramatic construction, and this shows in the way he builds the various relationships in the movie.</p>\r<p>There are a few too many speeches that are overheard by the camera - speeches that provide background information that the characters would probably not provide in quite that way. There are conflicts and tensions within the group, and sometimes we can feel them being created and manipulated by the script. If the genius of the movie is to show the unit through a camera, the movies failure is not to trust that approach enough. The development of the conflicts and character backgrounds should have been more subtle and offhand, as they might have been in real life. Still, 84 Charlie MoPic deserves a place by itself among the films about Vietnam. It is a brave and original attempt to record nothing more or less than the actual daily experience of a unit on patrol, drawn out of the memories of men who were there. Ive never seen a combat movie that seemed this close to actual experience, to the kinds of hard lessons that soldiers are taught by their enemies. The filmmakers have earned their right to shoot with a subjective camera - because the eyes we are really seeing through are their own.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p><a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/joel-schumacher\">Joel Schumacher</a>'s \"8mm'' is a dark, dank journey into the underworld of snuff films, undertaken by a private investigator who is appalled and changed by what he finds. It deals with the materials of violent exploitation films, but in a non-pornographic way; it would rather horrify than thrill. The writer is <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/andrew-kevin-walker\">Andrew Kevin Walker</a>, who wrote \"Seven,'' and once again creates a character who looks at evil and asks (indeed, screams), \"why?'' The answer comes almost at the end of the film, from its most vicious character: \"The things I do--I do them because I like them. Because I want to.'' There is no comfort there, and the final shots, of an exchange of smiles, are ironic; Walker accepts that pure evil can exist, and that there are people who are simply bad; one of his killers even taunts the hero, \"I wasn't beaten as a child. I didn't hate my parents.'' The movie stars <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/nicolas-cage\">Nicolas Cage</a> as an enigmatic family man named Tom Welles, who works as a private investigator and comes home to a good marriage with his wife (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/catherine-keener\">Catherine Keener</a>) and baby. He specializes in top-level clients and total discretion. He's hired by the lawyer for a rich widow who has found what appears to be a snuff film in the safe of her late husband; she wants reassurance that the girl in the film didn't really die, and Welles tells her snuff films are \"basically an urban legend--makeup, special effects, you know.'' The film follows Welles as he identifies the young woman in the film, meets her mother, follows her movements, and eventually descends into the world of vicious pornographers for hire, who create films to order for a twisted clientele. Joel Schumacher has an affinity for dark atmosphere (he made \"The Lost Boys,'' \"Flatliners'' and the two of the Batman pictures). Here, with Mychael Danna's mournful music and Robert Elswit's squinting camera, he creates a sense of foreboding even in an opening shot of passengers walking through an airport.</p><p>The purpose of the film is to take a fairly ordinary character and bring him into such a disturbing confrontation with evil that he is driven to kill someone. Tom Welles, we learn, went to a good school on an academic scholarship, but although his peers \"went into law and finance,'' the rich widow's attorney muses, \"You chose surveillance.'' Yes, says Welles: \"I thought it was the future.'' Mostly his work consists of tailing adulterers, but this case is different. He meets and talks with the mother of the girl in the film, traces her movements to Hollywood, and then enlists a guide to help him explore the hidden world of the sex business.</p><p>This is Max California (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/joaquin-phoenix\">Joaquin Phoenix</a>), who once aimed high but now works in porno retail; the film suggests that the Los Angeles economy takes hopeful young job-seekers and channels them directly into the sex trades. Through Max, Welles meets Eddie Poole (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/james-gandolfini\">James Gandolfini</a>), the kind of guy who means it when he says he can get you whatever you're looking for. And through Eddie, they meet Dino Velvet, a vicious porn director played by Peter Stormare--who was the killer who said almost nothing in \"Fargo,'' and here creates a frightening set of weirdo verbal affectations. The star of some of his films is Machine (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/chris-bauer\">Chris Bauer</a>), who doesn't like to remove his mask.</p><p>We expect Welles to get into danger with these men, and he does, but \"8mm'' doesn't treat the trouble simply as an occasion for action scenes. There is a moment here when Welles has the opportunity to get revenge, but lacks the will (he is not a killer), and he actually telephones a victim and asks to be talked into it. I haven't seen that before in a movie, and it raises moral questions that the audience has to deal with, one way or another.</p><p>I know some audience members will be appalled by this film, as many were by \"Seven.'' It is a very hard \"R'' that would doubtless have been NC-17 if it had come from an indie instead of a big studio with clout. But it is a real film. Not a slick exploitation exercise with all the trappings of depravity but none of the consequences. Not a film where moral issues are forgotten in the excitement of an action climax. Yes, the hero is an ordinary man who finds himself able to handle violent situations, but that's not the movie's point. The last two words of the screenplay are \"save me,'' and by the time they're said, we know what they mean.</p>",

In close-up, thick fingers make the final stitches in a roughly humanoid little rag doll, and binocular eyes are added. This creature comes to life, walks on tottering legs, and ventures fearfully into the devastation of a bombed-out cityscape.</span><br></p><p>\tThis visionary world was first created as a short subject by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/shane-acker\">Shane Acker</a>, a student at UCLA, and was nominated for a 2006 Oscar. At the time I found it \"an atmosphere of creeping, crashing, menace... elaborated as a game of hide and seek, beautifully animated and intriguingly unwholesome.\" So it is still, as the first figure, named \"9,\" meets his similar predecessors #1 through #8, and they find themselves in battle against a Transformer-like red-eyed monster called the Beast.</p><p>\tOne might question the purpose of devising a life form in a world otherwise without life, only to provide it with an enemy that wishes only to destroy it. The purpose, alas, is to create a pretext for a series of action scenes, an apocalyptic battle that is visually more interesting than, but as relentless as, similar all-action-all-the-time movies. This is a disappointment. Remembering the promise of his original short, I look forward to what Acker would do at feature length, especially with a producer like <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/tim-burton\">Tim Burton</a> to watch his back.</p><p>\tThe characters look similar, but easy enough to tell apart, not least because they have their numbers stitched on their backs. They also have different visual characteristics, and are voiced by distinctive actors, including <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/christopher-plummer\">Christopher Plummer</a> as their fearful leader, #1, and Jennifer Connolly as the token female #7. The usefulness of gender in a species without genitalia is not discussed, not even wistfully.</p><p>\tNine is the youngest, probably the smartest, and certainly the most daring, leading the others, against #1's wishes, to poke around the ruins. These look left over from a city from the past, not the future, and a 1940ish newsreel reports on a devastating global war triggered by a Hitleresque dictator. Was the Beast left behind to wipe out any survivors, and assure final victory even in the absence of victors?</p><p>\tSuch questions, I submit, are intriguing. But the dialog is mostly simplified Action Speak, with barked warnings and instructions and strategy debates of the most rudimentary kind. Since this movie is clearly targeted not at kiddies but at teens and up, is it now Hollywood theory that eloquence and intelligence are no longer useful in action dialogue?</p><p>\tOne of the benefits of the pre-CGI era was that although action scenes might be manifestly artificial, they had to be composed of details that were visually intelligible. Modern CGI artists, intoxicated by their godlike command of imagery, get carried away and add confusing complexity. If I were pressed to provide the cops with a detailed description of the Beast, the best I could do would be: \"You'll know it when you see it. Also, it has a big glowing red eye.\"</p><p>\tContrast that to the enormous construction in Miyazaki's \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/howls-moving-castle-2005\">Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle</a>.\" It is awesomely complex, but I have a large print of one of Miyazaki's still drawings from the film, and you can clearly see that it's all <i>there</i>.</p><p>\t\"9\" is nevertheless worth seeing. It might have been an opportunity for the sort of challenging speculation sci-fi is best at, however, and the best reason to see it is simply because of the creativity of its visuals. They're entrancing.</p>",

And a few minutes later looks at him very curiously as he walks away along the street.</p><p>They meet again, of course, and that is the beginning of their relationship, as chronicled first in a best-selling novel by Elizabeth McNeill and now in this movie by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/adrian-lyne\">Adrian Lyne</a>, the director of \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/flashdance-1983\">Flashdance</a>.\" It is clear from the start that they aren't going to follow an orthodox pattern of courtship and romance.</p><p>He offers her, quite boldly, an experimental erotic relationship.</p><p>The first time he touches her seriously is to tie a blindfold around her eyes. They advance into arenas of lovemaking often described in the letters column in Penthouse, and Elizabeth, for the most part, is prepared to let John call all the shots. He wants to be in control, and as she surrenders to him, she abandons herself to dreamy, erotic absentmindedness.</p><p>John is nothing if not inventive. In the scene that is likely to be the most talked-about in this movie, he blindfolds her and feeds her all kinds of strange foods - sweet and sour, different textures, each one a surprise to her. It's astonishing the way the movie makes this visual scene so tactile. John calls her at unexpected times, orders her to unorthodox rendezvous, and as she follows his instructions, they both seem to retreat more deeply into their obsession.</p><p>The movie contrasts their private life with the everyday world of her work: with the small talk and gossip of the art gallery, with a visit she pays to an old artist who lives like a hermit in the woods, with the intrigue as her ex-husband dates another woman in the gallery.</p><p>This everyday material is an interesting strategy: It makes it clear that the private life of Elizabeth and John is a conscious game they're playing outside of the real world.</p><p>Eventually, it is Elizabeth's hold on the real world that redeems the movie - makes it more than just a soft-core escapade - and sets up the thoughtful and surprising conclusion. As long as it is understood that she and John are engaged in a form of a game, and are conspiring in a sort of master-slave relationship for their mutual entertainment, Elizabeth has no serious objections. But as some of John's games grow more challenging to her own self-respect, she rebels. Does he want to engage her mind and body in an erotic sport, or does he really want to edge her closer to self-debasement? There are two times that Elizabeth draws the line, and a third time that she chooses her own independence and self-respect over what begins to look like his sickness.</p><p>That's what makes the movie fascinating: Not that it shows these two people entering a bizarre sexual relationship, but that it shows the woman deciding for herself what she will, and will not, agree to.</p><p>At the end of \"9 1/2 Weeks\" there is an argument, not for sexual liberation, but for sexual responsibility.</p><p>I have a few problems with certain scenes in the film. There is a moment when John and Elizabeth run through the midnight streets of a dangerous area of Manhattan, chased by hostile people, and take refuge in a passageway where they make love in the rain. The scene owes more to improbable gymnastic events than to the actual capabilities of the human body.</p><p>There is another scene in which John and Elizabeth go into a harness shop, and John selects and purchases a whip, while the shop employees do double takes and Elizabeth stands, wide-eyed, as he whooshes it through the air. There is no subsequent scene in which the whip is used. I do not argue that there should be; I only argue that, in a movie like this, to buy a whip and not use it is like Camille coughing in the first reel and not dying in the last.</p><p>Any story like \"9 1/2 Weeks\" risks becoming very ridiculous. The actors are taking a chance in appearing in it. Plots like this make audiences nervous, and if the movie doesn't walk a fine line between the plausible and the bizarre, it will only find the absurd. A lot of the success of \"9 1/2 Weeks\" is because Rourke and Basinger make the characters and their relationship convincing. Rourke's strategy is to never tell us too much. He cloaks himself in mystery, partly for her fascination, partly because his whole approach depends on his remaining a stranger. Basinger's strategy is equally effective, and more complicated. Physically, she looks sensuous and luscious; if you saw her in \"Fool for Love,\" you won't be surprised by the force of her first appearance here. But if she'd just presented herself as the delectable object of all of these experiments, it would have been a modeling job, not acting.</p><p>In the early scenes, while she's at work in the gallery, she does a wonderful job of seeming distracted by this new relationship; her eyes cloud over and her attention strays. But one of the fascinations of the movie is the way her personality gradually emerges and finds strength, so that the ending belongs completely to her.</p><p>Another new movie, \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-hitcher-1986\">The Hitcher</a>,\" is also about a sadomasochistic relationship. Because it lacks the honesty to declare what it is really about, and because it romanticizes the cruel acts of its characters, it left me feeling only disgust and disquiet. \"9 1/2 Weeks\" is not only a better film, but a more humanistic one, in which it is argued that sexual experimentation is one thing, but the real human personality is something else, something incomparably deeper and more valuable - and more erotic.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>Show rock concert, show sex, show icy wastes of Antarctica. Repeat eight times. That's essentially the structure of Michael Winterbottom's \"9 Songs,\" a movie that marks an important director's attempt to deal with explicit sex. As an idea, the film is fascinating, but as an experience it grows tedious; the concerts lack closeups, the sex lacks context, and Antarctica could use a few penguins.</p><p>To begin with the sex: The story involves a British scientist named Matt (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/kieran-obrien\">Kieran O&#x27;Brien</a>) and an American named Lisa (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/margo-stilley\">Margo Stilley</a>), who is visiting London for obscure reasons; she mentions jobs and studying. They meet at a rock concert in Brixton, go back to his place, and have sex. It is real sex. Real, in the sense that the actors are actually doing what they seem to be doing, and real, in the sense that instead of the counterfeit moaning and panting of pornography, there is the silence of concentration and the occasional music of delight.</p><p>Altogether, they go to nine concerts and hear nine songs, but this is not a concert film and the performers are mostly seen in long shot, over the heads of the crowd, which is indeed the way most of us see rock concerts. That works for realism, but it does the musicians no favors.</p><p>The nine sex scenes are filmed with the detachment of someone who has no preconceived notion of what the characters will be doing, or why. They lack the choreography of pornography, and act as a silent rebuke to the hard-core image of sex. Winterbottom seems deliberately reluctant to turn up the visual heat; he accepts shadows and obscurities and creates a certain confusion (in the words of the limerick) about who is doing what and with which and to whom. The occasional shots of genital areas are not underlined but simply occur in the normal course of events.</p><p>There is also some dialogue. No attempt is made to see Matt and Lisa as characters in a conventional plot. They talk as two people might talk, who have fallen into an absorbing sexual relationship but are not necessarily planning a lifetime together. Matt likes her more than she likes him. There's a revelation late in the film, concerning the flat where she lives, that is kind of a stunner. What Winterbottom is charting is the progress of sex in the absence of fascination; if two people are not excited by who they are outside of sex, there's a law of diminishing returns in bed. Yes, they try to inspire themselves with blindfolds and bondage, but the more you're playing games, the less you're playing with each other. Their first few sexual encounters have the intricacy and mystery of great tabletop magic; by the end, they're making elephants disappear but they know it's just a trick.</p><p>The Antarctic footage is mostly of limitless icy wastes. Matt's narration observes that a subzero research station causes simultaneous claustrophobia and agoraphobia -- \"like a couple in bed.\" Yes. They're afraid to be trapped, and afraid to leave. There is some truth here.</p><p>The sex scenes betray the phoniness of commercial pornography; when the Adult Film Awards give a prize for Best Acting, they're ridiculed, but after seeing this film you'll have to admit the hard-core performers are acting, all right; \"9 Songs\" observes the way real people play and touch and try things out, and make little comments and have surprised reactions.</p><p>That said, \"9 Songs\" is more interesting to write about than to see. Its minimalism is admirable as an experiment, but monotonous as an experience. To the degree that O'Brien and Stilley exchange dialogue on screen and inhabit characters, they suggest that a full-blown movie about these characters might be intriguing. What Winterbottom does in part I'd like to see him do in whole: Show a relationship in which two reasonably intelligent and sensitive adults pick each other up for sex, enjoy it, repeat it, and then have to decide if they want to take the relationship to the next level.</p><p>In many movies, the first sexual encounter is earth-shaking, and then the lucky couple is magically in love forever -- or at least until the story declares otherwise. In real life, sex is easy but love is hard. Sex is possible with someone you don't know. Love is not. In a way, \"9 Songs\" is about the gradual realization by Lisa and, more reluctantly, by Matt, that there is not going to be any love and that the sex is therefore going to become kind of sad.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>When Prince William experienced a major building boom in the 1990s, a shortage of labor created a demand for workers, which led to an increase in the Latino population. Some of the newcomers were legal immigrants. Some were not. A blogger named Greg Letiecq began to write about his unhappiness with hearing Spanish spoken in public places. Finding an audience, he fomented about rising crime rates, rising taxes to pay for services for the newcomers, overcrowded dwellings, music played too loud, fast driving, and so on. He included Latino crime reports from the local police blotter. He even claimed armed members of the Mexican revolutionary group Zapatistas were moving to Prince William County.</p><p>His organization, Help Save Manassas, issued saucer-sized red lapel stickers, and soon they were seen around the town. He and Board of Supervisors president Corey A. Stewart created a law that would require local police to stop people for \"probable cause\" and ask them to show their proof of citizenship. At the time, this measure seemed to have popular support, and there was resentment against a Mexican-American citizen who erected a large sign on his property (at 9500 Liberty St.) to object to it.</p><p>About this time, filmmakers <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/eric-byler\">Eric Byler</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/annabel-park\">Annabel Park</a> (a Chinese-American and a Korean-American) began to post videos on YouTube that weren't so much political as the raw material for a documentary. They showed discussions and arguments among local residents, testimony before the county board, Stewart, Letiecq and other pro-law figures and ordinary citizens. As the videos went viral, they inspired another local blog to counter Letiecq and a growing community discussion about the law.</p><p>Among the law's opponents was Charlie T. Deane, the long-serving, widely respected local police chief, who testified the law would cost about $14 million over five years to enforce, who said his officers had more important things to do and who said (along with the county attorney) that without video cameras in every police car, the officers and the county would be open to lawsuits. Cameras would cost another $3.1 million.</p><p>Ironically,the law was partly to blame for a tax rate increase of 25% a year. There was another problem. Latinos began to move out of Prince William County or take their business to nearby friendlier areas. There was a retail slump, badly timed to coincide with the collapse of the housing market. As tax-paying legals left, the county tax base dropped. Restaurants and shops closed. Prince William County and Virginia have sales taxes, income taxes and other taxes that even non-citizens pay.</p><p>Chief Dean met with a Mexican government official, and was incredibly accused of treason by right-wingers (for negotiating with a foreign power). This did not go over well. The Republican woman who had hosted a fund-raiser for board president Stewart testified against him at a board meeting. Then came a rising tide of opposition to the law and the negative image it gave to the area. A motion to raise taxes to keep the law and pay for the cameras drew a tie 4-4 vote, Stewart recessed for a caucus and returned with a new \"compromise\" motion ending the \"probable cause\" mandate, which resulted in an 8-0 vote. On the board at that time were six Republicans and two Democrats.</p><p>The most rewarding element of this deeply involved documentary involves the board meetings. Local citizens stand up to speak their minds, and we hear a great many of them. Some board meetings lasted until well past midnight. They were in the great tradition of New England town meetings.</p><p>Latinos were united in opposing the law. Many were longtime, well-known American citizens. But the balance was finally tipped by the voices of thoughtful Republicans and their distaste for the hate stirred up by Letiecq and his group. Calling Chief Deane a traitor was the last straw.</p><p>Park and Byler began as objective documentarians who found this story being pressed upon them. They become advocates and are clear about that. They try to show both sides of the debate, but (inevitably, perhaps?) the anti-law faction comes across more positively. </p><p>The outcome: Passing the law led to higher taxes, not lower ones. And as for the crime rate? Chief Deane has charts showing that crime dropped every single year over the past decade.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>I had an argument about capital punishment with some friends over the weekend, and I wish I could have taken them to see this movie. I was against the death penalty in principle, of course, but what really bothered me was the thought that a convicted person could be put to death on the basis of circumstantial evidence. There's just too much that can go wrong - as \"A Cry in the Dark\" and another current movie, \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-thin-blue-line-1988\">The Thin Blue Line</a>,\" both demonstrate.</p><p>\"A Cry in the Dark\" takes place in Australia and is based on the famous recent case of Lindy Chamberlain, the mother who said her baby daughter had been dragged away and killed by one of the wild Australian dogs named dingos. No one else saw the tragic event take place, and the initial rush of sympathy for the parents was replaced, after a few weeks, by a malicious whispering campaign.</p><p>Did Lindy in fact murder her own baby and only blame the dogs? The evidence against her began to pile up. A mark on a cloth looked like her bloody handprint. Blood was found sprayed all over the underside of the dash board in the family car. A dingo was not big enough to carry away a human baby. Worst of all, Lindy did not seem sufficiently distraught by the death. Charges were eventually filed against her, she was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison, and she served 3 1/2 years behind bars - even giving birth to another child there - before she was released. An appeals court quashed her conviction on on Sept. 15, 1988, declaring it a miscarriage of justice. You may have read about that in the papers or seen it covered on \"60 Minutes.\" Why was Lindy able to maintain her composure - even an icy facade - in press interviews and on TV? Why didn't she weep for her baby? There is the implication in \"A Cry in the Dark\" that if Lindy had behaved \"correctly\" in the media, the investigation that led to her conviction might never have been carried forward. In trying to help us understand Lindy, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/meryl-streep\">Meryl Streep</a>, the star of the movie, faces the formidable challenge of making an unlikable woman seem sympathetic. It appears that Lindy was not naturally prone to outbursts of emotion in public. She kept things bottled up. After she was charged with murdering her child, anger took over, filling her with a deep bitterness that was evident in her face and voice.</p><p>And there was another matter, the matter of the religious beliefs of Lindy and Michael Chamberlain (solidly played by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/sam-neill\">Sam Neill</a>).</p><p>They are Seventh-day Adventists in a country where that religion is in a small minority and widely misunderstood. While they spoke of reconciling themselves to the will of God, the public maliciously whispered that she had sacrificed her child in some sort of cult ceremony - an event that is unthinkable in terms of the Adventist religion. Whatever she did, Lindy and her husband were religious, emotional and social outsiders, and the press and the law were after them like a pack of dingos.</p><p>\"A Cry in the Dark\" takes the time to marshall the case against Lindy , and the time to destroy it. The blood under the dash board proved to be rust-proofing. Dingos could indeed kill and carry a human baby. And additional physical evidence (the coat the baby was wearing when she disppeared) turned up years later and corroborated Lindy's story.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/fred-schepisi\">Fred Schepisi</a>, who directed and co-wrote the film, has used Australian public opinion as a sort of Greek chorus in the background.</p><p>He cuts away to tennis games, saloons, filling stations and dinner parties, where the Australian public tries Lindy and finds her guilty (one hostess finally bans the subject at her dinner table, declaring that the case is not going to ruin another one of her parties).</p><p>Schepisi is successful in indicting the court of public opinion, and his methodical (but absorbing) examination of the evidence helps us understand the state's circumstantial case.</p><p>In the lead role, Streep is given a thankless assignment: to show us a woman who deliberately refused to allow insights into herself. She succeeds, and so, of course, there are times when we feel frustrated because we do not know what Lindy is thinking or feeling. We begin to dislike the character, and then we know how the Australian public felt. Streep's performance is risky, and masterful.</p><p>The final point of the movie, I suppose, is that when passions run high enough a court is likely to decide almost anything about anybody - especially an unlikable, unpopular member of a minority group who is charged with an unspeakable crime. When you combine that possibility with the uncertainty of circumstantial evidence and the human lust for revenge, you get a situation in which the death penalty can result in irrevocable tragedy. Lindy Chamberlain spent 3 1/2 years in prison for a murder she did not commit, but at least she did not die for it.</p>",

For <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/roman-coppola\">Roman Coppola</a> to waste one on \"A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III\" is a sad sight to behold. I'll go further.

Elliot Hostetter. Remember that name. The feverish colors and images that he conjures up in \"Charles Swan\" are the reason I kept watching, ready to examine every scene for its look but not its content. At times I caught myself trying to look beyond the actors, annoyed that they were blocking valuable background space.</p>\r<p>Every detail has been pushed to 11 on the \"Spinal Tap\" scale.

On one side, Charles has painted two eggs. On the other side, two strips of bacon. What were you expecting? A horse and carriage? </p>\r<p>Near the beginning of the story, Charles' girlfriend, Ivana (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/katheryn-winnick\">Katheryn Winnick</a>), leaves him. So distraught is he that he packs her shoes in a plastic bag and hurls them over the side of Mulholland Drive. This sets in motion a chain of events that ends with the Cadillac parked in a swimming pool with Charles inside. I pitied the automobile.</p>\r<p>Swan the Third owns a design studio, that, in the 1970s Pop Art style, has a giant toothbrush leaning against a wall. The loss of Ivana leads to him indulging an orgy of the sexual hunger that must have inspired her exit through the gift shop. Curiously, although he encounters countless beautiful scantily undressed young women in both life and his fantasies, his primary object doesn't seem to be the stake but the sizzle. Scantily Attired. You remember her. On the old Bob and Ray radio program, she was the never-heard twin sister of Natalie Attired.</p>\r<p>After the swimming pool incident, Charles suffers an unspecified chest attack, and experiences hallucinations. One involves Ivana's group, the Secret Society of Ball Busters. In one hallucination, Charles and his best friend, Kirby (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jason-schwartzman\">Jason Schwartzman</a>), are on horseback in the Old West and come upon Ivana and other almost nude Indian maidens who beckon them forward before warrior women on horseback attack them with bows and arrows.</p>\r<p>That's when we see Charles' agent, Saul (Bill Murray), step forward to offer advice. The name Saul is possibly a homage to the great designer Saul Bass, which may be obscure for today's audiences but nowhere near as obscure for them to recall that Charles Swan is the name of the hero of Marcel Proust's \"Remembrance of Things Past.\" </p>\r<p>Watching the movie, I found myself thinking at the screen: Give it up, Charlie Sheen. It's getting old. The purpose of this film didn't last long enough for it to justify being released.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>\"A Month by the Lake\" is a sly romantic comedy about a collision of sex, ego, will and pride, all peeping out from beneath great thick layers of British reticence. Its delights are wrapped in a lavish production in a beautiful time and place - Italy's Lake Como, in the spring of 1937; it's another one of those movies, like \"Enchanted April\" and \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/only-you-1994\">Only You</a>,\" about perfect places for a holiday.</p><p>In this case, however, much of the appeal comes from the characters who inhabit it, and who bring a style, eccentricity and humor to it that is unlikely to be supplied by modern tourists. Miss Bentley (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/vanessa-redgrave\">Vanessa Redgrave</a>) is a British spinster of a certain age, who is at the absolute peak of physical and mental perfection. All she needs is more self-confidence (or does she have it, and is she playing a subtle game?). On the first day of her month's vacation in an elegant lakeside hotel, she sees Maj. Wilshaw (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/edward-fox\">Edward Fox</a>), a handsome man whose elegant haberdashery is set off by a battered brown felt hat, worn at a reckless angle.</p><p>She likes his looks. Specifically, his ears: \"He has the ears of a kind and gentle man.\" She tells him so. I have written that a man will believe almost anything a woman tells him, if she begins with compliments. This does not apply so much to the ears. The major is, nevertheless, intrigued, and invites her to join him for a drink at seven. She is late - so late he has already gone in to dinner. Was she deliberately late? The movie is elusive. She pursues him, and yet at crucial moments she drops out of the chase.</p><p>Miss Bentley has a scenario of her own. She observes that the major always carries two tennis rackets, and offers to play a set with him. Now comes the movie's perfect moment, as Redgrave uses indescribable body language to portray a woman who, with all the awkwardness and ungainliness in the world, is a superb player and cannot help humiliating the major on the court. The sight of her hiking up her skirts and tucking them out of the way is worth the price of a ticket.</p><p>Within a few days, the major announces, regretfully, that he must return to England. Miss Bentley is devastated; this throws her timing off. As he is leaving the hotel, however, he is shamelessly flattered by Miss Beaumont (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/uma-thurman\">Uma Thurman</a>), the nanny of some rich Americans, who even plants a kiss on his face. \"That was cruel,\" Miss Bentley tells her. Miss Beaumont, who lives in the moment and relishes her power over men, couldn't care less. Her gesture has its effect: Soon poor Maj. Wilshaw appears again at the hotel, dragging his libido and pride with him, under the impression that Miss Beaumont really cares for him.</p><p>Edward Fox is an elegant and handsome man, but he is not particularly tall, and there is a scene here where Uma Thurman literally towers over him (her name is \"Beaumont\" - beautiful mountain - for a reason). Observe a scene where the major, having returned in hopes that the young nanny will fall to him, finds himself pursuing her. He would rather run, but dignity requires him instead to walk stiffly, as quickly as he can - his arms flapping behind him. He cannot match her long-legged stride. It is a moment that says more about his character than any words would dare to.</p><p>Vanessa Redgrave is tall, too, but able to lean forward and search for signs of thought in the hapless major's face.</p><p>What is intriguing about the film, written by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/trevor-bentham\">Trevor Bentham</a> and directed by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/john-irvin\">John Irvin</a> (\"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/turtle-diary-1986\">Turtle Diary</a>,\" \"Widow's Peak\") is that it never concedes it is about sex. Flirtation itself is the point of the game. Consider the scene where Redgrave and Fox go swimming - her body magnificent in a sleek black costume - and it would seem that they must fall into one another's arms. The movie understands that flirtation, indefinitely prolonged, is much more interesting to an audience than seduction, quickly consummated. It is always wise to give an audience something to look forward to, rather than wistful memories.</p><p>Words, indeed, remain largely unspoken in this world. The whole movie depends upon British style, reserve, codes and reticence - even the last awkward embrace. They are certainly capable of embracing more warmly. They have the skill, and even the occasion. They simply do not feel free to. Perhaps they believe it is better to spend the rest of one's life alone than to allow, for even a moment, a violation of one's personal style and standards. Perhaps they are right. Certainly without style and standards there would be no movie, no story, no Miss Bentley, no Maj. Wilshaw.</p>",

    "formatted_review_text": "<p>Eat your vegetables, they're good for you. That's what we were told as kids. Documentaries are sometimes deemed the broccoli of cinema: more nutritional than enjoyable. \"A Place at the Table,\" however, is a good documentary that is good for you.</p>\r<p>The bad news is that broccoli and bananas are neither available nor affordable for many Americans. That's the message of <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/kristi-jacobson\">Kristi Jacobson</a> and Lori Silverbush's \"A Place at the Table,\" a necessary report on the national issue of hunger.</p>\r<p>\"The relative price of fresh fruits and vegetables has gone up by 40 percent since 1980, while the relative price of processed foods has gone down by about 40 percent,\" states Marion Nestle, a nutrition and public health professor. \"We're spending $20 billion a year on agricultural subsidies for the wrong foods.\" </p>\r<p>\"A Place at the Table\" uncovers other contradictions. \"Mississippi has the highest rate of obesity,\" an onscreen title card notes. Bad diets often are the result of low income and cheap, processed food. About 50 million Americans \"don't know where their next meal is coming from,\" as \"food insecurity\" is defined. This costs our country $167 billion annually.</p>\r<p>\"If we don't change the direction we're heading, this generation will be the first to live sicker and die younger than their parents' generation,\" testifies a congressional committee member. The filmmakers find persuasive advocates from such groups as No Kid Hungry Campaign, Physician Task Force on Hunger in America, and Center for Food Policy and Obesity. </p>\r<p>Talking heads include the authors of \"Stuffed and Starved: Markets, Power and the Hidden Battle for the World's Food System\" and \"Breadlines Knee-Deep in Wheat: Food Assistance in the Great Depression.\" Participant Media, the film's co-producer, is releasing its own book, as it did in 2008 with the film \"Food, Inc.\"</p>\r<p>Actor <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jeff-bridges\">Jeff Bridges</a>, who founded the End Hunger Network 30 years ago, also appears in the film.</p>\r<p>In \"A Place at the Table,\" we meet a Philadelphia mother unable to feed her two kids, an overweight yet undernourished girl in rural Mississippi, and a fifth-grader in Colorado who imagines help from a reality TV show. \"Have you heard of the 'Extreme Makeover Home Edition'?\" Rosie asks. \"I always have a dream almost every night. I just wish they would come and actually rescue us from our house.\"</p>\r<p>Meanwhile, food banks nationwide numbered 200 in 1980. Now there are 40,000. Where is our government, ask anti-hunger activists. Back in 1968, CBS correspondent Charles Kuralt stated in the doc \"Hunger in America\" that \"the most basic human need must become a human right.\"</p>\r<p>Hunger is a crisis \"our own government is ashamed of acknowledging,\" argues Bridges. \"If another country was doing this to our kids, we would be at war. It's just insane.\"</p>",
