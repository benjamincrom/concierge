The characters had dialogue and occupied a real plot, which involved their motivations and personalities.</p><p>2. The action scenes were more or less believable. The cops didn't do anything that a real cop might not really almost be able to do, if he were in very, very good training.</p><p>I started taking notes along these lines, and here are a few of my jottings: When a cop shoots at a robber in a hostage situation, the hostage is wounded. The chief punishes two hot shots with demotions, instead of pulling their badges and guns and kicking them off the force. When the bad guy steals a cop car, we expect a chase, but he backs up and crashes it within a block. When the chase leads down to the Los Angeles subway system, the cops approach a stopped train, board it, and look for their quarry. Astonishingly, there is not a fight scene atop a speeding train. In a S.W.A.T. team training scene, the trainees are running toward a target while shooting, and somebody asks, \"No rolls?\" The veteran cop in charge replies: \"They only roll in <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/john-woo\">John Woo</a> movies--not in real life.\" That's the point with \"S.W.A.T.\" This isn't a John Woo movie, or \"Bad Boys 2,\" or any of the other countless movies with wall-to-wall action and cardboard characters. It isn't exactly real life, either, and I have to admit some of the stunts and action scenes are a shade unlikely, but the movie's ambition is essentially to be the same kind of police movie they used to make before special effects upstaged human beings.</p><p>The result is one of the best cop thrillers since \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/training-day-2001\">Training Day</a>.\" <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/samuel-l-jackson\">Samuel L. Jackson</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/colin-farrell\">Colin Farrell</a> co-star, playing the time-honored roles of veteran officer and young hothead. <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/michelle-rodriguez\">Michelle Rodriguez</a> and James Todd Smith (a k a LL Cool J), both effective actors, give depth to the S.W.A.T. team. And <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/olivier-martinez\">Olivier Martinez</a>, who played Diane Lane's lover in \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/unfaithful-2002\">Unfaithful</a>,\" is the smirking playboy arms dealer who offers a $100 million reward to anyone who springs him from custody.</p><p>The plot begins with a hostage situation gone wrong. A S.W.A.T. team member (Brian Gamble) disobeys orders, enters a bank and wounds a hostage. He and his partner Jim Street (Farrell) are offered demotions. Street accepts; his partner leaves the force. But Street, a talented officer and a great shot, is spotted by the legendary veteran Hondo Harrelson (Jackson), and chosen for his hand-picked elite S.W.A.T. team.</p><p>One of the pleasures of the movie is the training sequence, where Jackson leads his team through physical and mental maneuvers. Many recent action movies have no training scenes because, frankly, you can't train to do their impossible stunts -- you need an animator to do them for you.</p><p>A routine traffic bust leads to the unexpected arrest of Alex (Olivier Martinez), an internationally wanted fugitive. Alex offers the $100 million reward on television, the cops assume there will be a lot of escape masterminds hoping to collect the reward, and it's up to Hondo and his team to safely escort the prisoner to a federal penitentiary.</p><p>That it does not go smoothly goes without saying. I'm not arguing that the last 45 minutes of the movie are, strictly speaking, likely or even plausible, but nothing violates the laws of physics, and you can kind of see how stuff like that might sort of happen, if you get my drift.</p><p>\"S.W.A.T.\" is a well-made police thriller, nothing more. No Academy Awards. But in a time when so many action pictures are mindless assaults on the eyes, ears and intelligence, it works as superior craftsmanship. The director, <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/clark-johnson\">Clark Johnson</a>, is a veteran of TV both as an actor and director, and supplies a well-made film that trusts its story and actors. What a pleasure, after a summer of movies that merely wanted to make my head explode.</p>", "top_critics_meter": 0.37, "audience_meter": 0.58, "star_list": ["Samuel L.

I've been looking at these stories for half a lifetime, and, let's face it, they're out of gas.</p><p>There might have been a time when the command deck of Starship Enterprise looked exciting and futuristic, but these days it looks like a communications center for security guards. Starships rocket at light speeds halfway across the universe, but when they get into battles the effect is roughly the same as on board a World War II bomber. Fearsome death rays strike the Enterprise, and what happens? Sparks fly out from the ceiling and the crew gets bounced around in their seats like passengers on the No. 36 bus. This far in the future they wouldn't have sparks because they wouldn't have electricity, because in a world where you can beam matter--beam it, mind you--from here to there, power obviously no longer lives in the wall and travels through wires.</p><p>I've also had it with the force shield that protects the Enterprise. The power on this thing is always going down. In movie after movie after movie I have to sit through sequences during which the captain is tersely informed that the front shield is down to 60 percent, or the back shield is down to 10 percent, or the side shield is leaking energy, and the captain tersely orders that power be shifted from the back to the sides or all put in the front, or whatever, and I'm thinking, life is too short to sit through 10 movies in which the power is shifted around on these shields. The shields have been losing power for decades now, and here it is the Second Generation of Star Trek, and they still haven't fixed them. Maybe they should get new batteries.</p><p>I tried to focus on the actors. <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/patrick-stewart\">Patrick Stewart</a>, as Capt. Picard, is a wonderful actor. I know because I have seen him elsewhere. It is always said of Stewart that his strength as an actor is his ability to deliver bad dialogue with utter conviction. I say it is time to stop encouraging him. Here's an idea: Instead of giving him bad dialogue, why not give him good dialogue, and see what he can do with that? Here is a man who has played Shakespeare.</p><p>The plot of \"Star Trek: Nemesis\" involves a couple of strands, one involving a clone of Data (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/brent-spiner\">Brent Spiner</a>), which somehow seems redundant, and another involving what seems to be a peace feeler from the Romulan empire. In the course of the movie the Romulan Senate is wiped out by a deadly blue powder and the sister planet of Remus stages an uprising, or something, against being made to work as slaves in the mines. Surely slavery is not an efficient economic system in a world of hyperdrives, but never mind: Turns out that Picard shares something unexpected with his rival commander, although once I tell you that you can no doubt guess what it is, since the movie doesn't work you very hard.</p><p>There is a scene in the movie in which one starship rams another one. You would think this would destroy them both, and there are a lot of sparks and everybody has to hold onto their seats, but the \"Star Trek\" world involves physical laws which reflect only the needs of the plot. If one ship rammed another and they were both destroyed and everyone died, and the movie ended with a lot of junk floating around in space, imagine the faces of the people in the audience.</p><p>I think it is time for \"Star Trek\" to make a mighty leap forward another 1,000 years into the future, to a time when starships do not look like rides in a 1970s amusement arcade, when aliens do not look like humans with funny foreheads, and when wonder, astonishment and literacy are permitted back into the series. Star Trek was kind of terrific once, but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy.</p>", "top_critics_meter": 0.44, "audience_meter": 0.54, "star_list": ["Patrick Stewart", "Jonathan Frakes", "Brent Spiner"], "budget": "$60,000,000 (estimated)", "length": 116, "top_critics_total": 36, "aspect_ratio": 2.35, "metacritic_metascore_meter": 0.51, "genre_list": ["Action", "Adventure", "Sci-Fi", "Thriller"]}

It's very disturbing. It begins as one of those conventional family dramas with a little love, a little sadness, and a few easy truths, but it's anything but conventional. By the end, we've seen lives that aren't working and probably can't be fixed, and we've seen sex used so many different ways it seems more a weapon than a comfort.</p><p>The film opens in the reassuring environs of British domesticity. A long-married couple travel into London to visit their children. May (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/anne-reid\">Anne Reid</a>) still has her health and the remains of her beauty, but Toots (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/peter-vaughan\">Peter Vaughan</a>) seems always out of breath. They arrive at the expensive new home of their son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh), go for dinner at the flat of their daughter Paula (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/cathryn-bradshaw\">Cathryn Bradshaw</a>) and then Toots dies of a heart attack.</p><p>It's clear that Bobby and Paula do not much love their mother, although Paula goes through the motions; Bobby is always darting away for urgent conversations on his cell phone. May understands this, and yet when she returns home, she finds she simply cannot stay there: \"I'll be like all the other old girls around here, and then I'll go into a home. I'd rather kill myself.\" She returns to London, is greeted coolly by Bobby and his wife, but finds a role with Paula, who needs a baby-sitter.</p><p>At Bobby's expensive house, work is underway: His best friend Darren (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/daniel-craig\">Daniel Craig</a>) is building a new solarium. One night May hears Paula having sex in her living room, peers into the room and discovers that Darren is Paula's lover. This discovery causes something to shift within May, who becomes friendly with Darren, brings him breakfast and lunch on a tray, and asks him, \"Would you come to the spare room with me?\"</p><p>She is in her 60s, he is in his 30s (and married, with an autistic child). She is a sweet-faced matron, he is bearded and muscular. I was reminded of Fassbinder's \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-ali-fear-eats-the-soul-1974\">Ali: Fear Eats the Soul</a>\" (1974), with its tall Moroccan immigrant and its doughy German widow, and indeed Anne Reid looks a little like <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/brigitte-mira\">Brigitte Mira</a>, Fassbinder's star. But Fassbinder's couple had nothing in common but need; May and Darren find that they talk easily, laugh at the same things, are comfortable together. We follow them to lunch along the Thames and to the churchyard where Hogarth is buried; they are probably the only two people in the story who know who Hogarth was.</p><p>We think we know where the film stands: It will be about love transcending age. Not at all. That reassuring subject would leave Paula out of the picture, and she desperately pursues Darren and expects him to leave his wife. As sex gives May an inner glow and inspires her to improve her hair and wardrobe, desperation eats away at Paula until she looks almost as old as her mother, and more haggard and needy. She drinks, which doesn't help. After she and her brother guess the truth about May and Darren, Paula pushes to the center of the story with cold, unforgiving fury.</p><p>\"The Mother\" was written by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/hanif-kureishi\">Hanif Kureishi</a>, whose screenplays include \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/my-beautiful-laundrette-1986\">My Beautiful Laundrette</a>\" and \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/my-son-the-fanatic-1999\">My Son the Fanatic</a>.\" It has been directed by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/roger-michell\">Roger Michell</a>, who, hard to believe, is also the director of the comedy \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/notting-hill-1999\">Notting Hill</a>.\" Kureishi is relentless in peeling away the defenses of his characters, exposing their naked needs and fears. Familiar with the conventions of fiction, we expect to like someone in this movie. In the middle stretch, we like May and Darren, even while we're aware of something not right in their relationship (it isn't the age gap, it's something trickier). But by the end, there is nobody to like; we're faced with the possibility that to truly know someone is to wish you knew them less.</p><p>There is courage everywhere you look in \"The Mother.\" In Anne Reid, who follows May with unflinching honesty into the truth of her life. In Cathryn Bradshaw, whose Paula has never felt loved or valued by anyone. In Daniel Craig, who seems to understand why Darren wants to have sex with May, and helps us understand it, and then, when we think we do, shows us we don't. By the end, \"The Mother\" has told us all we need to know about the characters, except how to feel about them. It shows how people play a role and grow comfortable with it, and how that role is confused with the real person inside. And then it shows the person inside, frightened and pitiful and fighting for survival. I have a lot of questions about what happens in this movie. I am intended to.</p>", "top_critics_meter": 0.89, "audience_meter": 0.59, "star_list": ["Daniel Craig", "Anna Wilson-Jones", "Anne Reid"], "budget": "$79,560 (USA) (", "length": 112, "top_critics_total": 35, "aspect_ratio": 1.85, "metacritic_metascore_meter": 0.72, "genre_list": ["Drama", "Romance"]}

If you are a hardened horror movie fan capable of appreciating skill and wit in the service of the deliberately disgusting, \"The Devil's Rejects\" may exercise a certain strange charm. If on the other hand you close your eyes if a scene gets icky, here is a movie to see with blinders on, because it starts at icky and descends relentlessly through depraved and nauseating to the embrace of road kill.</p><p>How can I possibly give \"The Devil's Rejects\" a favorable review? A kind of heedless zeal transforms its horrors. The movie is not merely disgusting, but has an attitude and a subversive sense of humor. Its actors venture into camp satire, but never seem to know it's funny; their sincerity gives the jokes a kind of solemn gallows cackle. Consider the fact that it's about a depraved family of mass murderers who name themselves after Groucho Marx characters (Otis P. Driftwood, Rufus T. Firefly, Captain Spaulding) and that the sheriff calls in a film critic to give him insights into their pathology.</p><p>The critic is such a Groucho fan that he knows Groucho played God in Otto Preminger's \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/skidoo-1968\">Skidoo</a>\" (1968), something I also knew, but I bet you didn't. The sheriff wants to bring in Groucho for questioning, but the critic knows he died in 1977. \"Elvis died three days earlier and stole all the headlines,\" he moans, risking death at the hands of the sheriff department's Elvis fans.</p><p>\"The Devil's Rejects\" has been written and directed by <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/rob-zombie\">Rob Zombie</a> (also known as Robert Cummings and Robert Wolfgang Zombie), a composer and music video producer whose \"The House of 1,000 Corpses\" (2003) was a \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" wannabe. Pause for a moment to meditate on the phrase \"A 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' wannabe,\" and you will begin to form some idea of Zombie's artistic vision. Now give him credit, in this movie, not for transcending \"Chainsaw Massacre\" but for sidestepping its temptations and opening up a mordantly funny approach to the material. There is actually some good writing and acting going on here, if you can step back from the material enough to see it.</p><p>The film opens with a 1978 police assault on an isolated farmhouse where, we learn, 75 murders have taken place. Inside the house, the Firefly family armors itself with steel masks and vests, and shoots it out with the sheriff (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/william-forsythe\">William Forsythe</a>). He is a hard-bitten, vengeful man who cheerfully informs a deputy to be cautious, or he'll be \"cold-slabbed, toe-tagged, and mailed to your mom in a plastic bag.\"</p><p>Mother Firefly (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/leslie-easterbrook\">Leslie Easterbrook</a>) is captured in the raid, but Otis (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/bill-moseley\">Bill Moseley</a>) and his sister Baby (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/sheri-moon-zombie\">Sheri Moon Zombie</a>) escape through a storm sewer (odd, in the Texas desert) and meet up with their father, Captain Spaulding (<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/sid-haig\">Sid Haig</a>). He is a man whose teeth are so bad, they're more frightening than his clown makeup. He plays such a thoroughly disgusting person, indeed, that I was driven to <i><i>www.sidhaig.com </i></i>to discover that in real life Sid looks, well, presentable, and even played a judge in Tarantino's \"<a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/jackie-brown-1997\">Jackie Brown</a>.\" This was a relief to me, because anyone who really looked like Captain Spaulding would send shoppers screaming from the Wal-Mart.</p><p>The sheriff pursues the fugitive Fireflys, who kidnap innocent bystanders in the kind of motel no reasonable person would ever occupy, leading to the road-kill scene, which is, of its kind, one of the best I have seen. There is also a scene in which a staple gun is used to post the photos of murder victims in a particularly gruesome manner, and one where characters are nailed to chairs in a burning building and then rescued by a character who deals with the nails in a surprisingly forthright way.</p><p>I suppose you're getting the idea. There's a sense in which a movie like this can be endured only if you distance yourself from the material and appreciate its manipulation of the genre. It can be seen as dark (very dark) satire. Or, you can just throw up.</p><p>At the end, when we get mellow flashbacks to the characters sharing a laugh in happier days, we are reminded of all those movies that attempt to follow a sad ending with a happy one, and we have to admire the brutality with which Zombie skewers that particular cliche.</p><p>OK, now, listen up, people. I don't want to get any e-mail messages from readers complaining that I gave the movie three stars, and so they went to it expecting to have a good time, and it was the sickest and most disgusting movie they've ever seen.
